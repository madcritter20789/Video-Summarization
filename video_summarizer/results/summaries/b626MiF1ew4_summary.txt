**General**:
1. Parkour is a discipline of training your mind and body to overcome obstacles.
2. It's a process of breaking down obstacles like in your head and figuring out the different parts.
3. You might be physically capable of doing a new jump, but at the same time there's a fear telling you that you're going to get hurt.
4. Rolls are something that can save your life or your knee.
5. suppress that fear, learn to control it and listen to it.
6. Know when it's right and when you know better.
7. I tore two muscles in my knee because I fell off a building and I didn't roll.
8. The way that I learned best to do this is that you swing with your foot through.
9. That will provide you, that will provide your body with the motion up you need.
10. And your hands are just there to support you when you come back down.
11. So it's a little bit weird but basically watch how I'm using my right foot on the jump..
