1. It's a great part of Montfolio tradition where we carry this green Laurel and it definitely feels like an induction ceremony of sorts.
2. We'll do the chain and do it in the walk with our sister and our older sisters and our grandmother's class.
3. I think all of us walking in white just definitely like seals the deal for that show.
4. "It's kind of like seeing all of your ancestors marched before you and what they've done," he says.
5. 1500 feet is the total length of the chain that they'll carry side by side.
6. "There was no one where else to come but Montfolio College in September 1915 because I was a legacy," he adds.
7. The 50th reunion in class began a tradition of a scarfing ceremony with the seniors and adopting granddaughters.

12. The whole hoolio just means a lot here.
13. It feels like the culmination of every day at Mount Holy.
14. "I have a lot of women who have come before us who paved the way for us and hopefully we're paving the way," she said.
15. "Just seeing I think 100 years behind us too and knowing that there will be 100 years in front of us is fantastic.
16. It's so exciting".
