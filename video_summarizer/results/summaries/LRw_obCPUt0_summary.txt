**General**:
1. James Duffey is the chef at Joseph Leonard in the West Village.
2. He says fried chicken can be deceiving because on the outside, you might just tap it with your finger and be like, all right, that's ready.
3. But it's trapping heat that could burn your tongue.
4. I would go toe to toe with anybody out there on a fried chicken competition.
5. I want something that's going to bring some acid to my chicken sandwich.
6. I think just the way the chicken itself plays with the honey and the sweetness of that, the spiciness in Tabasco, the crunch of the cucumber.
7. I think it's delicious.
8. It's one of those things we've tried taking it off the menu.
9. And we've had a lot of pushback from guests who come on a regular basis for it.
10. We are trying really, really hard to make connections with our guests..
