**General**:
1. There's three kinds of bead styles.
2. Tubeless tire design like car tires have a partially locking ceiling system to bead to rim.
3. You may need to squish the tire in a vice, press it in a tire machine, or place the tire going to change right in front of the wheel of a vehicle.
4. If you have no tube in there, you don't have to worry but if you have a tube you have to be very careful not to prick your tube.
5. Another method is put the rubber part of the tire on your face of your jack and put underneath a high vehicle or something heavy and start jacking it up.
6. If you have a tube tight tire you only have to peel one side off.
7. You can just lift your tire up and get enough space in there to get your hand in there and get out the tube.
8. If you want to completely take the tire off the rim it's best to just flip it over like I did now and work from the back side.
9. The only way to get your tire back apart is actually put a hole in it and bleed the air out and start all over again.
10. To put it back on, we've got the valve stem over there, a vice grip opposite to it.
11. Now I'm going to stand as best as I can here.
12. To reseal the bead takes a lot of pressure because it's at high pressure locking bead.
13. ATV tires or quad tires are very low pressure so they don't use air to give a tight fit to lock the bead to the rim.
14. They have a bead locking design which is very difficult to break.
15. The tire has a high pressure locking bead because the tires are low pressure.
16. If you're doing hard cornering, you don't want the tire to flip off the rim and then roll your machine.
17. Go to a place and have someone break the bead for you..
