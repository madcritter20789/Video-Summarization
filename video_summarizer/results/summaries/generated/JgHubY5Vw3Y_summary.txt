**General**:
1. A bike is an important investment and you want to keep it safe.
2. The first thing I recommend is getting rid of any quick release levers on your bike.
3. If you have a daily commuter that's locked up outside a lot, you might want to consider some camo for your ride.
4. Don't ever leave your bike unlocked.
5. Make sure to lock it to a solid object that can't be broken or moved.
6. Your bike won't ride any different but it'll be much less attractive to thieves.
7. If you're using a chain lock too, loop this through the front wheel and around part of the frame..
