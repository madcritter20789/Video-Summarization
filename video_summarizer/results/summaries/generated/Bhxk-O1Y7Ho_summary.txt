**General**:
1. Bentley is going to get a bath and a trim.
2. "I don't like the way that he came out.
3. When I took him to the grimmer.
4. Last week I felt like she just deserved him and I like it" "I think I kind of desensitized him to the hair dryer in his face because I just rapid fired kibble at him when I was using the blow dryer" "I was able to actually blow out his head and it's not all wavy.
5. I could have blew him out better but you know what? I think I actually did a pretty good job" "We are like in the catacombs of Atlantic station.
6. And we're going to get so lost.
7. Because this parking garage is like so big and we already messed it up like once" "This elevator smells like pee.
8. There's the concierge.
9. Let's just hurry" "It's not perfect.
10. You do something the first time.
11. It's never perfect.
12. Look at all that hair.
13. He's getting really wiggly and I'm not feeling good.
14. I think it's time for me to take some more drugs" "He has a couple spots that aren't perfect.
15. But it's my first time.
16. I mean it's okay.
17. And also he just got blown out.
18. So when his hair grows back and his natural oils come back, it'll blend a lot better" I got a bath, a blow dry, and a haircut.
19. And a top sprout.
20. It says it's a knot, but I don't have a full knot yet.
21. Because I'm still a baby puppy.
22. Can you give him the kisses, my boobies?.
