**General**:
1. Dogs and cats naturally wear down their nails while walking, running or scratching trees.
2. Cutting the nails can be difficult for both of you.
3. Initially, it seems that it will be impossible, but with love and patience it can be done.
4. When the dog is relaxed, cut one nail at a time, talking to him the whole time.
5. Consult your vet or pet shop if you have any questions.

**Critiques**:
1. Some animals don't, and this can be a problem.
2. Make sure you look for the dew claw and cut the nail because sometimes this can cause problems and become embedded in the skin..
