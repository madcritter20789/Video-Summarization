**General**:
1. Asaprite forces you to draw every single pixel.
2. And believe it or not, that's not the go-to technique used by top tier pixel artists.
3. This is one of those well-capped secrets in the word of pixel art.
4. We can delve deeper into it another time.
5. When it comes to 2D art, it's hard to beat the versatility of Photoshop.
6. Sure, Asaprite is very easy to use and the alternative might take a bit more time to master, but remember what we said.
7. Slow down to go faster.
8. Photopia is a remarkable alternative to Photoshop and I can't emphasize this enough.
9. Crita might be a bit lower in heavier in the system when you're tinkering with filters, politicization, blending, if we compare it to Photoshop or photopia.
10. Crita is 20% more expensive than photopia, which means that you can get it for zero dollars as well.
11. Crita can also be used for pixel art, there's a lot you can do with filters and politicization.
12. Google docs, Google sheets and Google slide have no aesthetic appeal, actually they are ugly.
13. The third code of my game gen winning game.
14. I've decided to make the construct project available to you.
15. You will get behind the scenes look on how the game was set up.
16. I'm creating a million list for the folks who are interested in game development and want to follow my journey.
17. It has been a while since I deep my toes into 3d game development.
18. I've made some 3d assets of the game you are seeing on the screen right now.
19. This is a game from 2008 and it was supposed to be a VR game before Oculus Rift was a thing.
20. I wouldn't advise indie or solo devs to chase after high fidelity graphics.
21. Instead opting for a distinctive stylized 3d style could be your best bet.
22. For audio, I don't have much to say.
23. Construct 3 takes all the boxes for a 2D game development.
24. It boasts some basic 3d features, and most importantly, it makes me very productive.
25. Type.
26. Script is a programming language I really like.
27. Plus, I use it in my daily work.
28. VS Code is much lighter than its custom visual studio, and it has many extensions that you can use to customize the editor and improve your workload.
29. Construct 3 has this feature that exports all the type definitions and the TS config of your project in such a way to use it in VS Code..

**Tools**:
