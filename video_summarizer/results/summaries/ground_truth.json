ITR filling TUTORIAL for CRYPTO INVESTORS | Crypto Tax | Income Tax Return\"\nTranscript: \"(00:00) Rs 15,790 Cr This is the amount which the Indian Government has tracked By taking 1% TDS on all Crypto Transactions Yes! In the last Financial Year, The government collected 157.9 Cr from TDS Which accounts for 1% Of every transaction. This means, after 1 July, 2022 If you have done any transaction in Crypto Then it will reflect on your 26AS If any transaction of Crypto If you have earned profit Then it is mandatory for you to file Tax There is no basic exemption of 2. (00:32) 5 Lakhs If you have incurred an overall loss Then this loss Against that particular transaction profit You can offset that Assume, your Crypto loss is in Lakhs But, in a particular transaction, overall, you have earned Rs 10,000 in profit And the same Rs 10,000 You have earned total in the year Even then Tax liability would be levied on you And Income Tax department is extremely serious about this Last year when through TDS, there was no tracking done Even then, Crypto-related notices were sent to 700 people The number will be higher this year too. (01:01) Because, through TDS every transaction has been tracked And one important thing Crypto is now in PMLA i.e Under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act has been added under the amendment. Any Crypto transaction Whether it's trade, swap or sell Or If you are buying any goods in that That will come under PMLA i. (01:22) e If you haven't done any proper compliance under this Then heavy penalties and action can be taken against you I am not saying all of these things to scare you. In fact, I am stating this to make you aware In today's video, we will cover Everything you need to know about Crypto Taxation Plus, in the same video On How to File Crypto Tax I will share an easier method of that too Jagruk Janta My name is RJ i. (01:43) e Rishabh Jain You are watching Labour Law Advisor If you haven't subscribed to the channel Then do it And surely press the bell icon [Intro Music] Before moving ahead, I would like to thank our sponsor for today: ClearTax Who have developed a Phenomenal product Which is India's only End-to-end Crypto Filing Portal This portal of Clear Tax 100+ exchanges i. (02:10) e Binance, CoinDCX, MudraX Compiles the data from everywhere Quite easily Mentions about Tax computation to you. And wherever there are Tax saving opportunities It does the computation automatically After this, directly via Clear Tax You can file a complete ITR And it is so easy to use this product First time taxpayers, students, everyone can easily file their return on this The link to register is in the pinned comment Do check it out Through ClearTax, your Crypto Games By declaring that How can you file your ITR We will have a discussion towards the end of the video (02:41) CRYPTO = VDA As you know Between Crypto and Government There hasn't been much co-ordination In 2013, RBI initially got the notification Investment should not be done in Crypto This is not safe After that, the Government introduced a ruling wherein the Banks were told to stop Crypto transactions Later, the decision was overturned in Supreme Court Finally, in 2022 - 23 Budget Government introduced all the rules and regulations The ones who govern the Taxation of Crypto. (03:10) In this, the Government told a very important thing. They told Crypto is not a currency. Because, only the Central Bank can issue a currency And all the Cryto, NFT, etc They termed it as Virtual Digital Assets VDA Tax Calculation Now as this is an asset It's Selling, Trading, Swapping Or else by purchasing any goods against it The gain that we receive That is known as Capital Gain. (03:34) Capital Gain means Your Sale Price - Purchase Price Let's understand this with an example Assume there is an Investor RJ He bought 2 coins Andy coins worth Rs 1L & Mandy coins worth Rs 1L After a while, the value of Andy coins becomes 0 And the value of Mandy coins exceeds to Rs 2L And he sells both these coins. (03:56) He sells Andy coins for Rs 0 And sells Mandy coins for Rs 2L So, in the Andy coins His Cost price, i.e Cost of Acquisition That was Rs 1L Sale Price was 0 i.e Capital Gain became: - Rs 1L That means a loss of Rs 1L Therein, in the case of Mandy Coin Sale Price was of Rs 2L Rs 1L was our Cost of the Acquisition i.e Our Capital Gain formed Rs 1L. (04:21) Now, this Capital Gain of Crypto Under the Income Tax Act section It is taxed based on 30% rate That means, whichever Capital Gain is forming 30% Tax will be levied on that If the Capital Gain is of Rs 100, then Rs 30 as Tax And this has been applied from FY 2022 - 23 This means from 1 April 2022 - 31 March 2023 All your Crypto Transactions The Capital Gain received on them. (04:45) The tax on that If the deadline gets extended beyond 31 July 2023 Then you need to file before that deadline. CASE STUDIES Now let's understand this concept in detail Through a few questions. Assume RJ Investor has bought several Cryptos Has bought BTC, has bought Ether But, has not sold So If he hasn't sold, then does he have to pay Tax Then answer is No When you sell an Asset Then a Capital Gain is realised on that The tax that is levied is only levied on the Realised Capital Gain If you have kept it on hold Then you don't have to pay any tax on that (05:21) - \"Where is our money?\" - \"That's the best part - It's on the Batman Flash Drive On your keychain. - You have had it in your pocket all along\". Now assume that Your RJ Investor His Total Income is below Rs 2.5L Assume he earns Rs 1.5L from Salary And earns an Income Rs 10K - Rs 20K from Crypto. So whether Tax will be levied on this case Or will he get an exemption of Rs 2.5L. (05:45) The answer is Rs 2.5L exemption He won't receive for Crypto Gains The Income that he is received from Crypto Assume there is a Capital Gain of Rs 20,000 Then he has to pay tax on that Rs 20,000 Now the 3rd question which is very interesting As I told you in my example initially To RJ, with respect to Andy coin and Mandy coin He incurred loss on Andy coin And he has earned profit only on Mandy coin. (06:08) If we check this overall Then he invested Rs 2L And now he has Rs 2L i.e overall no profit no loss situation So, does he have to pay Tax in such a situation The answer is Yes Their Income Tax Act states that Any loss connected to Crypto You cannot offset that That means, Rs 1L gain earned from Mandy coin On that you will have to pay Rs 30,000 tax But Rs 1L loss incurred on Andy coin The Income Tax department has no connection with it - If you have done 5 Trades On different currencies. (06:38) On 1, there has only been a profit of Rs 1,000 On everything else, you have incurred losses Rs 1L each Cumulatively, you incurred a loss of Rs 4L But still you have to pay a tax of Rs 10,000 Why has the Government kept it This could also be interesting for the audience That Now Crypto has not been streamlined in the Financial streams. (06:58) Whichever, normal currencies are there or trading Government requires that the fraudulent activities They should be curbed And it is estimated in the further that once all of this is financially streamlined That in this A lot of rules will be changed Next question A lot of you'll might have watched our Tax videos They know that Capital Gain are of 2 types Short Term Capital Gain - Long Term Capital Gain What will happen in the case of Crypto? Assume I have held my Crypto for a long time. (07:26) So now I am selling them Will I get the benefit of Long Term capital gain? The answer is No In Crypto, for Short Term or Long Term There is no different rate Whichever could be your Capital Gain Tax will be levied based on 30% rate Now, few intelligent people will say I haven't sold Crypto against INR I have only swapped it Assume I had BTC I converted that into Ether Or I converted that into Stable Coin I didn't receive any money So, do you have to pay Tax in this case too The answer is Yes! If you swap your Crypto (07:59) If you are converting it from one currency to a different currency Then, you technically consider this as That you initially converted your BTC into INR From that INR, you bought Ether In this case, whichever Capital Gain you are receiving On that sale of BTC It has been realised And you will have to pay Tax on that And lastly, If you are buying a product from Crypto Then, while purchasing that product The rate on which you bought Crypto On a higher rate, you are processing the payment, while buying the product (08:27) On that, you will have to pay Tax In conclusion, If you have traded on Crypto If you have swapped Crypto If you have purchased anything from Crypto In all these cases, All the Capital Gain that you have You need to pay 30% tax on that Apart from this, you won't get any benefits on exemptions/ deductions. That means, even If you have a little bit of Capital Gain in Crypto Even then, your Tax liability will be applicable And I had mentioned initially in the video That Government is able to track all your transactions (08:57) via TDS We will talk about that shortly in the video. Hence, it's very important Watch this video until the end All this was about trading Now, let's talk about By other means If I have earned Crypto. I don't mean by paying money. I have received Crypto from other means So, where I receive Crypto from? I might receive it through Gift. (09:13) I might receive it through Salary. I might receive it against Professional Services. I might get it through mining I might get it through staking AirDrop. Or else I created an NFT and launched it In this way, I could receive Crypto in such forms Through such cases, How will the Tax be levied? Firstly, let's talk about GIft And later we will talk about everything else In the case of Gift There is a simple exemption If you are accepting the gift From your Non-Blood relatives Then you don't have to pay Tax on the 1st 50,000 (09:43) i.e your Rs 50,000 Gift will be exempt I took Rs 50,000 from Rohan Via Crypto As a gift Then I don't have to pay any tax on that. But, If I took anything above Rs 50,000 Then I will have to pay tax on that. But, in the case of Blood relative Assume that You got Crypto from your parents as a gift Then there is no limit on that. (10:02) Now, in any other means Whether it's Salary, Professional Income, Staking, Mining Or through NFT If you have received any additional income. Then all of it is taxable Now how much tax will be levied on this rate Then, few professionals state that That you add this to your Income And file tax as per your Slab But, as per my understanding And we have spoken to a lot of experts They have told us That you have to pay tax based on 30% Assumed, you mined few Cryptos and you received Bitcoins worth Rs 20,000 After mining (10:35) Then on that Rs 2000, you have to pay Tax on the basis of 30% Assume, you received a gift worth Rs 1L in Crypto Then after deducting Rs 50,000 Then on the remaining Rs 50,000 You have to pay Tax on the basis of 30% There is another interesting thing in this Assume you received Bitcoin worth Rs 1L You removed Rs 50,000 before After that, on the remaining Rs 50,000 You paid tax on the basis of 30% After that, this Crypto of Rs 1L You spent for Rs 2L. (10:59) The capital gain that you have received after that Even then you have to pay 30% tax Now, let's talk about those few transactions. Wherein there is no Tax levied on Crypto Firstly, a Crypto Hold You HODL it (to buy-and-hold indefinitely) There will be no Tax levied on that From one wallet of yours to another If you are transferring your Crypto Then no tax will be levied on that If overall in a single Financial year You have received Crypto less than Rs 50,000 as a gift You don't have to pay any tax on that And from blood relatives (11:25) If you are receiving any amount of Gift In Crypto Then no tax is to be paid on that Now, let's talk about How does the Government track every transaction? So the Government is tracking this transaction via TDS. After 1 July 2022, Government has levied TDS on Crypto's sale amount Assume, RJ The Investor has sold his Bitcoins worth Rs 1L By visiting any Exchange Then I will only receive Rs 99,000 in return And Rs 1,000 as a TDS Will be deposited against my PAN Which will be reflected in my Form 26AS. (11:55) This means Few tax on your behalf Of Crypto has already been deducted against your PAN has been deposited with the Income Tax Department. So If overall In loss or any other transaction If you have not earned any profit Because, this TDS is also deducted in a loss transaction So, If you file your return Then you will get a refund on this amount Then, you understood TDS on Crypto You have understood Tax on Crypto Now the question arises For the Crypto to reflect in Income Which ITR form should we file? So If you file through Clear Tax (12:26) Then automatically the right ITR Form will be selected. But, for your information If you show Crypto as a Capital Gain Then you will file ITR 2 But, If you show it as a Business Income Then ITR 3 should be filed Note that in both the cases The tax rate would be 30% And after showing your Business Income You cannot claim any expenses on this Now, we will talk about Via Clear Tax Portal How will you be able to file your Crypto Taxation very easily? I am providing you the link in the pinned comment. (12:54) Visit the website and simply sign in via Google And you will get a list of a lot of Crypto Exchanges Binance, CoinDCX, MudraX, CoinSwitch In this, in whichever 1 or 2 If you have done transactions in your exchanges. By clicking on it. Via API Key or Via a FIle upload You can add all your transactions here Through this API Key How are you supposed to extract the data? Or How are you supposed to upload the file? It's PDF guide On every Exchange page You will get it for download After Importing the file Or after importing the date through the API (13:28) Your Overall P&L Of Crypto, will be reflected to you And after moving step by step ahead How much Tax is forming on that That will also be shown to you Apart from this, If you have any other transaction Which have not happened on these exchanges You can report those here too So Friends!
