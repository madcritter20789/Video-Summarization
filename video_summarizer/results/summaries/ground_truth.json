they're worse so omega-3 fatty acids are in you know they're essential for many things and um I think you're referring to one specific study that came out of uh Dr Bill Harris's group he's the head of the fatty acid Research Institute and he's actually the pioneer of the omega-3 index test which is how you should measure your omega-3 levels um they're measur in our red blood cells rather than which you'll 99% of the time find if you get a omega-3 test it's plasma (00:37) levels so red blood cells take about 120 days to turn over so it's a long-term marker of your omega-3 whereas if you go and get a omega-3 plasma test it's kind of like what did I eat for dinner in the last week right so you you may have had a bunch of salmon but maybe you don't usually eat salmon so so anyways the omega-3 index is a way to measure omega-3 levels and he had done a study looking at omega-3 levels and what's called all cause morta lity so people dying from all sorts of non-accidental causes cardiovascular disease disease is (01:09) always at the top of the list because that's pretty much what everyone's dying of that's like the number one cause of uh death in most developed countries and so um he was looking at all cause mortality and correlating that with the omega-3 index which essentially is measuring omega-3 fatty acid levels and um what he found was that so people that have a low omega-3 index so that would be 4% or ease and heart attack risk so you can just have a little bit of cigarettes and your your heart disease risk skyrockets and Omega-3s one of the biggest things that it protects against is heart disease right doctors prescribe it so there's been randomized control trials where people are given high do omega-3 purified omega-3 um in the form of either EPA which is one of the Marine sources or a combination of DHA and EPA (05:22) um and and and a variety of Studies have shown that like heart attack r ey give you so much data but like you have to like know what to do with it so they measure all these things but like and everything else right um and they also tell you the form it's in so I mentioned ethylester for the prescription form there's also triglyceride form those are the two main forms that you can find fish oil (09:52) supplements or Omega-3 supplements in and um generally speaking triglyceride form is is the most bioavailable triglyceride form is what is the form if you're eating fi mean it's insane huge problem in in you know many schools where in the US yes in the US where vaping vaping in class in the bathrooms yeah they've installed these are 12 13y old detectiv in the (14:30) bathrooms of uh British schools yeah no it's a problem here too especially in public schools and I so I I personally like I'm biased and I I'm like good like I don't want these like it's ter it's so easy and it's like bubblegum flavored it's like it's like geared towards CH I almost feel like was ly or it's Health Technologies or it's deliver delivery mechanisms for things that we used to have but this is in a new way and what does that actually mean so yeah we'll get back to talking to rondra in one minute but first I need to tell you about Ketone IQ 60% of tour France Riders use Ketone IQ to help them with their energy and mental Clarity and that's why why I use it as my pre-workout I don't want to have caffeine upon waking but I still want to (19:32) have energy to make sure that I ha f the muscle as a reservoir for it because when we have a period of um basically we're not getting (23:56) an intake of amino acids we need it we need amino acids to survive like we need them and so our body pulls from our muscle so in the morning if you think about it what's the longest period you go without having amino acids well it's when you're sleeping so breakfast is actually really important it's it's important to get protein amino acids in that first meal because if you extend that me i es about five hours to digest okay so after the five hours after your last bit of food in the mouth now you're in a fasted state right so that's going to be when you're sleeping most likely um you don't have to skip a meal you can eat your food within an eight hour period and (28:58) fast for 16 hours without having to skip a meal most of the time unless I guess unless you're an Entertainer and your meals do come later then but still you can still like everything's just shifted over and yes you' ng let's say that they've got to get to work they're part of the you know they're the 6 a.m. (33:13) CrossFit Clow crowds they're not going to be up at 4:30 doing their scrambled eggs so that they can digest it in time to go do Fran they're going to probably do a protein shake like whey protein so you would still even for the people that are up early and then go to go on train it's such a high PR it that you would still suggest consuming some protein prior to working it's hard to get 1. (33:33) nth de life and you got pancreatic cancer you got fill in the blank cancer um and there are of course studies associating magnesium intake with cancer and you know studies looking at DNA repair as well so the way I like to think about nutrition is what do I need to get for my diet that is essential for for me to be functioning optimally for me to prevent the damage that can lead to neurod degenerative (37:53) disease to cancer um that's that's kind of the way and then also what do I need to get vitamin but getting getting U B vitamins zinc um also you want to get iron these are also important micronutrients you know minerals that's where you get the meat right so red meat for the iron and protein B vitamins it's got zinc um as well poultry is another option right so (42:35) these are good sources of um protein and other micronutrients that you're not going to get as much from Plants what do you thinking about when it comes to saucing and choosing your Meats uh yeah so there's been some another added reason to kind of have more diverse Whole Foods type of diet we'll get back to talking to rondra in one minute but first I need to tell you about mentas (47:10) you might have heard me say that I took my testosterone from 495 to 1006 and two of the supplements I used throughout that were fidji Regus and tonat Ali I first heard Andrew hubman talk about the really impressive effects that these have on testosterone but the problem is most supplements don't actually Ain what they say now it's like I want I want to be on (51:38) top of my game so you just can do a 10-minute you know workout it could be high intensity interval training where you're shifting between periods of vigorous exercise and then kind of resting a little bit and then so you do these intervals or it could just be like I'm going to do a 20 minute like run and I'm going to go you know I'm going to do it so um exercise exercise is the number one I would say big mover as you said it's also the most requires t cocoa flavanols out there the kakin consumer Labs tested them and I've seen I've seen the data it's it's very clear they're very high in in they just out compete all the other brands out there and they also have the lowest contaminants so they're really uh a good but expensive way to get those cocoa flavonols which are really good and then the other one would be for cognition would be lutein which I mentioned earlier it's in egg yolk it's not very (56:44) concentrated it's in kale very highly c n you're sick you have brain fog but we can talk about how it overlaps with that so I think there's really two big it all has to do with meals and and and eating um so the first thing I think that's highly involved in this reduction in mental Clarity or brain fog as people like to call it is what's called the postprandial glucose response so that means blood glucose (1:01:34) levels going up after a meal and um what happens is this if you have a really high postprandial glucose response you're e se that I went the other evening that was phenomenal but Deans Deans and Three Forks are the uh two steak restaurants I go to the most uh but Deans do this they call it a bread Crown so it's like a literally looks like a little crown that comes out kind of about that size and (1:06:18) there's a pot of whipped butter in the middle of this thing and it's glazed on top it's got like a salt glaze this thing is like crack it's so good and it's it's just there you arrive you sit down you've got the d gen and so it gets activated and um what ends up happening there is one your immune system is activated okay that requires a (1:10:40) ton of energy so energy is shunted away from your brain and it goes to the immune system because your body goes triage is it goes I need to survive there's a bacteria there's a bacterial Invader in my system right now I'm going to take all my energy and I'm going to make sure that I get rid of this invader I don't die right so that's that's the first thing that's e got some sweet stuff to have (1:14:49) after that the sense that you get in your body especially if you haven't been outside if you've basically not moved because you're feeling a little bit miserable and you the curtains are drawn and you've just laid in bed and the Uber driver or whatever's come and you've taken the food off him the inflammation like the throbbing that you feel in your body it's almost like your heartbeat feels like or your blood pressure feels like it's gone up and then alm m more sensitive to the feel-good endorphins so that you feel better later and um so now there's been um some scientific research first from Charles Ron back in I think it was like 2016 he had done a study where people were they basically like it was a type of of sauna more like an infed SAA it was elevating their core body temperature to about feverish State like a 101. (1:19:55) 3 and there was a sham control which was the placebo they were getting hot enough to think they were getting the tre e it really does you're getting you're getting that oxygen to your brain you're getting more nutrients and bdnf plays a role in depression so that stuff I think immediately improves mood but there's also um you know so so what neurotransmitters are involved in (1:24:16) mood or you know mood what is mood when we talk about it well I mean it's complicated like I don't even know that we can Define it exactly I mean there's there's you you have things like serotonin it's involved in mood uh motivat ality as people that were you know slept fine without so in other words interesting exercise can negate the bad (1:28:47) effects of lack of sleep on all cause mortality and I also glucose response goes up with lack of sleep like you're you're you're um you're basically going to have a higher postprandial glucose response to food you're going to have a higher fasting blood glucose level when you don't get enough sleep well you're also going to select for foods that are more salty more sweet I me ke right (1:33:26) after that and with basically no break with no break they just go into the sauna after and then V2 Max was measured so V2 Max is like your best way to measure cardiorespiratory Fitness right so maximum amount of oxygen you're taking in a maximal you know exercise so um the their VO2 max was better in people that did that exercise the the stationary bike plus the sauna versus just the stationary bike right and that is a lot because sauna to some degree is mimicking moderate int eople that use it two to three times a week they have a 24% lower all CA mortality right so the bare minimum would be two if you want something um this is compared to people that use it one time a week but if you want the most robust effects the bare minimum would be four up to seven right every day so that would be frequency now temperature and duration most of those studies in Finland the average temperature in the Publications is about 174 175 degree Fahrenheit and the duration in that sauna nutes in at 180 190 something like that uh to make sure that it's 174 uh and then take a little break and then go back in is that a way that you could maybe get away with doing three times a week or two times a week and still try and capture some of those really good gains um I don't know that that data is there to make that statement but I do know that there have been studies looking at going repeatedly and taking taking a few minutes break (1:43:24) and going back into the sauna and what is cl t'll prevent disuse atrophy by like 40% I snapped my achilles 3 years ago full Detachment playing cricket and it was 13 days from when that happened until when I got my surgery uh so I'm waiting for I wanted a very particular surgeon in the UK to come and do it one of the the guys had been highly recommended to me which (1:47:49) meant I had to wait a little bit longer 13 days of not stepping on my right leg and it was gone it was so alarming to look down and see especially because you've got th ike the men went in and like put their leg or something like that in the in the ice bath for 15 minutes and this was right after the workout okay or they did passive recovery where they were actually on a stationary bike so the control group wasn't just sitting around (1:52:40) they were actually in my opinion increasing hypertrophy by movement okay just that's clear I think that's a flaw of the study and so the people that did the ice bath right after there were there was train work at how stil ia in your fat you're you're basically making it's basically you're making more energy you burn more energy but you also release heat as a byproduct and so it's an adaptation the (1:57:17) more you use the cold the it's called Browning of fat and the reason for that is because when you look at a fat droplet under a microscope and there's more mitochondria in it it looks Brown compared to White so so that's also something that happens and most of the studies looking at Browning of fat in humans h and legs and doing a little bit of toning like vocal (2:01:59) like toning stuff and uh that was wild I'd never done that before we tend to just get in sit in for two to three minutes get out go back in the SAA but that was really interesting the effect of doing that was was pretty cool yeah doing a workout in there because again you're you're it's like making your workout harder right it's like because they're both sort of to some degree doing like doing at least physiological response is kind op of the yeah exactly and it's like okay I'm making more mitochondria and my muscles but I want to be doing hit and vigorous EXC for all the other benefits and guess what I get mitochondrial biogenesis from that like pretty robustly is that um with the brown browning of the fat is that uh wrists in and clavicle in is that one of the cues that I've heard about this have you seen this stuff no I don't that's interesting so there'll be people screaming at us in the comments (2:06:40) but um when I ile you're exercising it's your brain is working harder while you're exercising just like your heart and your mou muscles your brain is working harder too and lactate is feeling that and you're you're you're basically increasing norepinephrine and serotonin from that lactate so lactated self is actually it can be used as an energy source a very utilizable energy source (2:11:37) much like beta hydroxy berate which is a ketone body that you make when you're either fasting or on a ketogenic diet u camps almost everyone listening will be training in some way or another right this is an audience of Jack people but one will skew toward the bodybuilding style training it'll probably be a three to five day split like Push Pull legs or maybe a body part split or something like that uh and those people will likely be trying to (2:16:09) hit you know their six to 10,000 steps per day so they'll be focused very much on the resistance training there'll be another Camp of people who are like heavy o 0- minute workouts where you're doing like 75 80% max heart rate for 30 minutes okay so they're doing that eight times a week yeah I mean so no they're also doing they're (2:20:50) doing other things as well so they're doing it's not when I say four hours a week they're exercising four hours a week they're also thought you meant they were doing four hours of this full by full no no no no no they were doing exercise four hours a week um but they were doing um a majority of that was maximal intens tensity interval training protocols he does a lot of research on (2:25:19) it at McMaster University um in Ontario Canada and he also says you there you know there there's evidence that a one minute protocol so like just even doing like an interval like one minute interval and then doing that like you know a few times also can improve V2 Max so that's a little easier and ALS it's easier like I like I I do one minute intervals um I'm trying to now incorporate the 4x4 into my routine um which is c ty cardiovascular related mortality and this was even true for people that identified themselves as non-exercisers so they aren't these are people that are not going to the gym or doing other like tennis or whatever they don't have Leisure Time physical activity so the benefits were also in people that identified as non-exercisers so my point is that the vigorous intensity these like even short bursts of it just consistently like every day a little bit like they do add up there's additive effect ually helps with digestion of food a little bit as well like if you've had a really big meal and all you want to do is lie down actually probably one of the best things that you can do to make yourself feel better is maybe go for a a walk what would you say here we've got the The postmeal Walking crowd and the postmeal burpees crowd like is there something that that that you're missing from one of those or are you happy with (2:35:16) either um well I don't know about the whole arms movement ain was like 30 minutes a week or so of like resistance training you know where I'm just doing dumbbells or something and now I'm doing 2 hours a week maybe a little bit more so that is a new focus and I'm working with the coach because I've noticed I do I'm much more likely to injure myself when I'm just like (2:40:03) doing it myself and I don't really know what I'm doing and I'm following like a pelaton class or something so now I'm working with a coach who's um really great and I just I'm I was so he like walks the talk uh but he came on and he was explaining about about the the typical sort of Bro Science rep range which was 8 to 14 any more than 14 and it's completely pointless his rule or at least what the (2:44:59) evidence seems to show is that anything over six and below 30 as long as when you finish you are looking at one to two uh one to three R reps in reserve so that's what you're talking about here he's Brad shonfeld is one of the guys that he respects the most in the indus 's making you tired inflammation is what's giving you that that tired feeling and so exercises is the the (2:49:19) counter to that right exercise is one of the most robust ways you can have an anti-inflammatory response because your body is naturally you know there's one thing I mean we talked about taking Omega-3s I mean there's ways to reduce inflammation by by by taking certain phytochemicals or Omega-3s but exercise is forcing your body to use all of its genetic Pathways to counter that inf so that distance is (2:54:01) measured um and then that there's this calculation that is done um considering you know the distance that you're whatever you've run and everything and that turns out your V2 Max and that's kind of what the Apple watch uses but the Apple watch doesn't know when you're like running hills and stuff so it's it's kind of because that that takes it into account so if you're running hills and stuff it's more challenging you're not going to go as.",

        "input": "(00:00) you know it's been thought of that our brains do not regenerate our brain cells are not renewed okay this is a completely false information because the brain cell can regenerate in fact it's the rate at which your brain cells regenerate that determines how your cognitive functions going to work or not work as you get older So today we're going to talk about how to actually increase this regeneration of your nerve cells by a factor of 5x okay now yes this research was done in animals and there's also a lot of research done in humans as (00:37) well so as I go through the list I want to cover a lot of different things that you can do to increase the size of your brain and you don't have to do all of them you just need to pick as many as you can do and if you wouldn't mind go ahead and add those to the comments of those things that you feel that you can add to your current lifestyle to increase the size of your brain or at least the Regeneration of your neurons because this list could be a little bit overwhelming to some people you know you can't do everything but you just do what (01:09) you can something is better than nothing and the general term for a nerve regenerating is called neurogenesis a lot of This research is done on a part of the brain called the hippocampus the hippocampus well they don't know exactly but it's involved in the relay of information that's connected to memory learning spatial navigation remember layouts of certain things problem solving which you kind of need your memory for problem solving reasoning and something else called object in place memory that's like remembering certain (01:41) objects in certain environments like where did I put my keys Etc now realize this just because you don't remember where you put your keys does not mean you have a problem with your brain it could be that you just ate poorly the day before it could be that your blood sugars are not quite correct if your spouse a family member or your parent or whatever starts having memory problems the worst thing you can do is to remind them of that and point that out because it's almost like the more that you remind someone like you know are you (02:13) losing your memory uh the more they start losing their memory and even when I was in practice I would notice this with married couples that would be coming in sometimes the spouse would be correcting them if they you know said something wrong or pronounce something wrong or forgot something and I pulled it aside and I just said you know what if they do that again just kind of ignore it okay and I followed up with them and I found that the person stopped making these mistakes when the person stopped reminding them that they were making (02:46) these mistakes so I think what happens if you hyper focus on something it actually sometimes could make it worse one thing that's really interesting about the brain okay is that if we take a look at the size of the brain and how much it weighs and we compare that to the rest of the body it only really makes up like two percent of the whole body weight yet it requires 20 percent of the oxygen of the body 20 of the metabolism of the body is given to the brain so it's an energy Hawk and this is why this first thing (03:19) I'm going to tell you is so important out of all the things you can do to increase the size of the brain and prevent atrophy is regular consistent exercise and the type of exercise that would be best is aerobic exercise and what I mean is getting a lot of oxygen now this is not to say that other types of exercise is is not also really good but if you can also include long walks for example or some type of exercise where you can get a lot of oxygen that would be even better than other types of exercise but I personally like to mix it (03:51) up I do high intensity on certain days I might do hiking or long walks on other days that is the most important thing you can do to enhance your brain regular exercise on the opposite would be inactivity right not exercising being inside all day that would not be good for your brain the second most important thing for your brain would be fasting and I'm going to say just like intermittent fasting but also a periodic prolonged fasting very potent stimulator of certain factors that help grow your brain and repair the brain function so (04:32) you need to be doing two meals a day with maybe a fasting period of at least 16 17 18 hours okay that would be ideal but if you can do longer like a one meal a day and and fast for 23 hours that would be even better and this would all depend on your lifestyle and also how much repair that you need to do on the brain because maybe you have some other issues like but the point is that when you eat too frequently and have these snacks which is just a killer for a lot of problems the brain suffers the most okay so this (05:08) idea that you have to constantly fuel the body of the brain is false information it does very well when you don't eat so frequently and then periodic prolonged fast for like maybe 48 Hours the next thing cold therapy very potent stimulator of neurogenesis which is the regrowing of your nerve cells so that could be an ice bath that could be in just taking a cold shower some of you are not going to do this but some of you will do it but it definitely will stimulate the Regeneration of brain now if you combine all three of these you (05:44) can look way back in time when we were always Starving in the cold and we're constantly exercising to run and chase animals to eat them and so our DNA has been developed off that has adapted off those three things to survive better because we needed our brains sharp so if you're out in the cold and you're exercising and you're not eating you can really support your brain versus always being in a very comfortable environment being around food all the time like having a refrigerator and just sitting back and being inactive other things you can do (06:24) omega-3 very very potent stimulator of growing your brain that would be like cod liver oil why because a good portion of the brain is composed of something called DHA which is a type of omega-3 fatty acid okay so that would help you greatly and it's very easy to do to have some fish oils or cod liver oil that you consume on a regular basis now on the flip side of that the other oil that's really bad for the brain is oxidized oil like in the oils that are heated like vegetable oils to create those oils you have to heat them up with (07:02) solvents like hexane and then you use them in heat too right you actually use them to fry something or cook something or deep fry something very very bad for your brain of course recently we've substituted those for the saturated fats being the coconut oil the lard the butter are actually very very good to cook things in they're very stable as long as you keep your carbs low and so that relates to the next point a low carb diet because sugar and refined carbs and just eating a high carb diet creates a lot of oxidation to the brain (07:38) and the Hallmark of neurodegeneration is glucose hypo metabolism where glucose is not being able to be metabolized in the neurons okay that's the Hallmark that occurs within the nerve cells which means the destruction of the nerve cell occurs because it's not getting glucose fuel so does that mean you need to eat more glucose no it means that you already ate too much glucose and you created insulin resistance and now you basically create this resistance for glucose as well and that's what destroys it you basically starve off the nerve of (08:18) energy how can we use that information we can lower the amount of glucose that you eat and we can feed your neurons a much better fuel which is ketones so ketones are the fuel that can bypass this damage of glucose and go right in and feed the neurons directly so how do we do that well we just lower our carbs and our bodies will naturally generate ketones we can also take ketones as a supplement we can fast and generate ketones do fasting intermittent fasting we can also consume MCT oil because you're going to generate more ketones (08:55) now I've mentioned cold therapy but you also can do heat therapy which like in a sauna or a hot shower that can also be beneficial but not as beneficial as the cold therapy I'm sorry another thing that's really beneficial to the brain is vitamin B1 thiamine and the opposite to that a thymine deficiency which is very common is the worst zinc for the brain okay when someone does not have enough B1 you start developing this condition called wernick key course cough syndrome it's a condition where you're very deficient in B1 and the neurons are (09:33) degenerating okay so you have all sorts of problems in the brain and this usually occurs because you're eating a lot of refined carbohydrates or too much sugar and so when you don't have enough B1 you actually get inflammation in your brain and B1 is uh connected to so many positive things for our bodies but especially for the brain and also to get rid of stress all right the next one is probiotics which is interesting because there is a connection between your gut and your brain right I mean the microbes in your gut make all sorts of the (10:03) serotonin and other neurotransmitters and other factors so if there's a problem in your gut there's a problem up here in fact one of the side effects of taking an antibiotic is problems with your brain mood cognition and even potentially certain types of dementia which is interesting so if you just support your gut you actually can help this regeneration of your brain cells so that would be consuming like foods that have friendly microbes probiotics sauerkraut fermented food certain vegetables that are grown on (10:39) soils that have microbes and also that fiber in the vegetables can actually feed the microbes if you have many different types of vegetables or different types of lettuce leaves that would be better because it's going to create a more Diversified microbiome but also there's another antibiotic or at least something that was patented as an antibiotic and that is glyphosate that's the chemical in the GMO so that can actually alter our gut microbiome another reason why you should have organic type foods now another thing (11:17) that can actually support your brain is the sun you're going to get a type of energy called infrared from the sun over 50 percent of the sun's Rays is infrared and it can penetrate through your skull okay and actually that can increase your melatonin which can act as an antioxidant to support your brain but that's interesting and then also you have the vitamin D from the Sun that can also help the brain versus being indoors to all sorts of artificial lights that do not help your brain at all and then there's also plant-based phytonutrients (11:52) that are really good for your brain curcitin turmeric B phytonutrients in green tea I mean there's just so many different autonutrients in so many plants that can help you then we also get foods high in choline okay choline is kind of the raw material for acetylcholine a really common neurotransmitter in your brain you need acetylcholine and that's made out of choline so what foods are high in choline well you have egg yolks okay you also have organ Meats fish okay so all of those are really important for your (12:30) brain and then we also have grass-fed animal products right grass-fed versus grain fed grass-fed are more anti-inflammatory because of the omega-6 to three ratios you want those like one to one so that's just another point that you want to be aware of when you're consuming animal products there is a big difference and then we get to its sufficient sleep not just the number of hours of sleep but the quality of sleep that you get okay is very very important if you have an insomnia and you're living on caffeine and stimulants it's (13:02) going to start to affect the Regeneration of nerve cells now what about this topic of coffee well too much caffeine can definitely create a problem with your brain but if you have just a small amount of coffee it's not going to be a problem especially since there's polyphenols in the coffee that can support the brain but excessive amounts of caffeine if you drink too much can override that and create a lot of problems because if you think about it when you drink coffee it does stimulate your cognitive function (13:31) right so over stimulation of that can be damaging another really key nutrient for the brain especially the hippocampus is zinc okay zinc is involved in different enzymes if you're deficient in zinc that can create an atrophy of hippocampus and affect your cognitive function as well as your mood now since I mentioned this topic of Omega-3 like the DHA oils which is so important in brain health and it's a real easy thing to implement I put some more information up with this video right here you should check it out.",
        "output": "Neurogenesis and Brain Regeneration\n\nContrary to outdated beliefs, brain cells can regenerate, and the rate of regeneration affects cognitive function as we age.\nNeurogenesis primarily occurs in the hippocampus, which is linked to memory, learning, and problem-solving.\nKey Strategies for Boosting Brain Health\n\nExercise: Regular aerobic exercise enhances oxygen flow and supports brain health. Mix aerobic activities with high-intensity and long walks for best results.\nFasting: Intermittent and prolonged fasting stimulates brain repair and growth by reducing oxidative stress and promoting ketone production.\nCold and Heat Therapy: Cold exposure (e.g., ice baths, cold showers) and heat exposure (e.g., saunas) stimulate neurogenesis.\nDietary Recommendations\n\nOmega-3 Fatty Acids: Found in fish oil and cod liver oil, these are essential for brain health, particularly DHA.\nLow-Carb Diet: Reducing refined carbs and sugars minimizes oxidative stress and supports neuron energy needs via ketones.\nCholine-Rich Foods: Egg yolks, organ meats, and fish are critical for acetylcholine production, a key neurotransmitter.\nProbiotics and Gut Health: Fermented foods and diverse vegetables promote a healthy gut microbiome, positively affecting brain function.\nNutrients and Supplements\n\nVitamin B1 (Thiamine): Essential for brain function and reducing inflammation.\nZinc: Crucial for hippocampus health and cognitive function.\nPhytonutrients: Found in green tea, turmeric, and other plant-based sources, these provide antioxidants to protect the brain.\nLifestyle Adjustments\n\nSleep: Quality sleep is essential for brain regeneration; insomnia and excessive caffeine can hinder this process.\nSun Exposure: Infrared light and vitamin D from sunlight enhance brain health and melatonin production.\nAvoiding Harmful Substances\n\nLimit oxidized oils (e.g., vegetable oils) and prioritize stable fats like coconut oil, lard, and butter.\nAvoid excessive caffeine, which can overstimulate and harm cognitive function.\nEvolutionary Perspective\n\nActivities like fasting, cold exposure, and exercise align with ancestral survival mechanisms that sharpened brain function.\nCall to Action\n\nIncorporate as many of these practices as feasible into your lifestyle for improved brain health and neuron regeneration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n."

        "input": "\"Every Trading Strategy Explained in 12 Minutes\"\nTranscript: \"(00:00) Fibonacci retracements it is a tool that displays horizontal lines based on the Fibonacci numbers these lines can then be used as key support and resistance levels to use the Fibonacci retracement tool you first start by identifying a swing low and swing high on a chart then drag the tool from the swing low to the swing High next wait for the price to make a pull back to one of these levels ideally the 0. (00:27) 382 Fibonacci level because that's the most common level where price tends to reverse from so if price touches that level that could be a good buy entry keep in mind that price could also reverse from other Fibonacci levels combine it with other confirmation signals to get a better entry breakout patterns it is when price makes a sudden and significant movement towards One Direction This usually forms after the market makes a consolidation period for example here we can see that the price is consolidating then it suddenly moves sharply to the downside (00:59) this is called a Breakout to take advantage of this Traders could use specific patterns as a guide to identify breakouts before they happen most notable breakout patterns includes wedges triangles and the rectangle pattern reversal patterns it is when price moves in the opposite direction of the current Trend and forms a counter Trend specific patterns could be identified in a chart which could help Traders predict reversals before they happen most notable reversal patterns are double top and bottoms triple top (01:29) and bottoms Head and Shoulders cups and handles aliot wave it is a theory that suggests that market tends to move in a series of five waves before reversing and forming another set of waves in the opposite direction by understanding the Elliot wave sequence Traders could predict where the price is Heading by following the pattern in a chart we can label each point of the Waves as 1 2 3 4 5 and ABC now there are specific rules to ensure that a movement is considered as a valid Elliot wave first wave 2 cannot be longer than wave 1 and usually (02:05) pulls back to the 0.618 Fibonacci level second wave three must be the longest wave amongst Wave 1 3 and five third Wave 4 must remain above the peak of wave 1 and usually pulls back to the 0.382 Fibonacci level so here's an example of the Elliot wave in action in this chart we can see that the price resembles a possible one 23 Elliot wave and So based on the theory of wave 4 which is that price tends to pull back to the 0. (02:38) 382 Fibonacci level before continuing upwards we can use this as a potential buy entry when price makes a pullback fair value gaps a fair value Gap occurs when a candle forms a significant Gap due to an imbalance of buying or selling to find a fair value Gap you first need to find a candle with a large body then draw a rectangle at the Gap place between the previous candles swick and the next candles swick this level now acts as a potential magnet where price May revisit before continuing its movement Candlestick patterns it is a technique that Traders use to analyze (03:15) future price movements by looking at specific Candlestick shapes notable Candlestick patterns include engulfing patterns which signal strong momentum towards the direction of the engulfing candle hammer and shooting star patterns which indicates rejection as shown by the long Wick on one side DOI patterns which signals neutrality in the market ha kanashi it is an indicator that fully replaces a traditional Candlestick chart to a hinachi chart when applied it tends to give less noise than a traditional Candlestick a green hinachi candle (03:48) signals that the price is on an uptrend and a red HK kanashi candle signals that the price is on a downtrend the size of the candle's body also indicates how strong a trend is the larger the candle the stronger the trend keep in mind that the ha kanashi only acts as an indicator it does not display the real market price moon phases it is a concept that utilizes moon cycles to time the market moon face Traders believe that Moon cycles are correlated with human emotions and behavior which could have an influence on the market specific Moon (04:19) phases are believed to be favorable towards a certain Trend a new moon means the market tends to be bullish and a full moon means the market tends to be bearish today it is used mostly As as a confirmation tool ranko it replaces a traditional Candlestick chart to a ranco chart so unlike a traditional Candlestick which forms a new candle based on a certain period of time a ranco chart forms its block based on the change of price for example every 1% change in price a wrinkle block appears this means that each wrinkle block represents a 1% (04:54) change in price of course you can change the parameters of this through the indicator settings Traders could utilize ranco Tarts to filter out noise and identify Trends a Green rankle Block signals an uptrend and a red rankle block signals a downtrend and keep in mind that Rano charts only acts as an indicator it does not display the real market price harmonic patterns these are Advanced price patterns that follows a specific shape based on Fibonacci numbers Traders can then use these specific shapes to predict future price (05:24) movements for example a bullish bad pattern is formed when price makes a series of four movements ments that is shaped like the letter M each point can be labeled as x a b c and d and each of these points has a specific guideline for example point x to point B needs to have a value between 0.382 and 0. (05:44) 5 point a to c needs to have a value between 0.382 and 0.886 and the same thing works for the other points next these specific guidelines can then be applied onto a real chart so if you see a price forming a series of four movements you can apply the har monic pattern tool to check if the price that formed matches a patterns guideline if it does then you can take a position based on the pattern that formed there are multiple harmonic patterns that exist most notable are butterfly bat crab and each have their own unique values support and resistance (06:21) these are key levels that formed horizontally where the price has bounced off in the past and could possibly bounce again in the future if the level is below the Price It's called support where you can take a buy position if the price approaches it and if the level is above the price it's called resistance where you can take a sell position if the price approaches it Dynamic support and resistance similar to support and resistance Dynamic support and resistance also acts as key levels but instead of using static horizontal lines (06:51) it uses indicators like the moving average to act as our key level trend lines trend lines are key levels that form diagonally during a trend Market you can use trend lines to identify the overall direction of the price upwards trend line means bullish downwards trend line means bearish and similar to support and resistance you can also use the trend line to identify possible entry scenarios for example if price retraces back to a trend line it can be a good opportunity to take a buy position gone angles it is a tool that (07:24) displays multiple lines that spread continuously on different angles these lines can then act as possible key levels and could also help you measure the strength of a trend price moving within the Steep angles of the tool indicates a strong Trend and price moving within the shallow angles of the tool indicates a weak Trend to apply the Gan angles first you go to settings then make sure to check the lock price to Bar ratio next identify a market range and mark the swing low and the swing highs of that range then draw a straight (07:56) vertical line at the start of the range after that select the trend angle tool and measure 45° then use the gun fan tool and place it at the 45° angle momentum indicators these are the types of indicator that measures the direction and strength of a trend it is most effective when used in trending markets some of the most notable momentum indicators are macd an upwards crossover indicates a bullish Trend while a downwards crossover indicates a bearish trend moving averages price being above the moving average signals a (08:30) bullish Trend and price being below signals a bearish trend parabolic are a DOT below the price indicates a bullish Trend and a DOT above the price indicates a bearish trend super Trend green signal indicates a bullish Trend and a red signal indicates a bearish trend oscillators these are the types of indicator that displays the relative strength of a price it is most effective when used on choppy or sideways markets most notable oscillators include RSI when the line is in the oversold region it indicates a possible reversal to the (09:03) upside if it's in the overbought region it indicates a possible reversal to the downside stochastic if both lines are at oversold it signals a possible reversal to the upside and if both lines are at overbought it signals a possible reversal to the downside these two lines can also cross over each other to predict future price movements divergences divergences occur when an indicator displays an opposite signal of the real price movement when this happens it is usually a sign that the trend might reverse divergences could (09:34) occur in many indicators such as the macd stochastic and the RSI for example here using the macd indicator you can see that the price is forming higher highs which is bullish but the indicator shows the opposite a lower highs which is bearish in this case this is a bearish Divergence which signals that the price may form a reversal and so you can take a sell position volume indicators these are types of indicator that shows the strength behind a price Movement by tracking the trading volume notable volume indicators include (10:09) price volume which displays the volume for each candle the longer the bar the higher the volume volume weighted average price which shows the ratio of an asset's price to its total volume it can be traded like a moving average or as a dynamic support and resistance volume profiles it displays a volume bar horizontally which can be treated as key levels for potential entry positions supply and demand also referred to as order blocks these are zones where significant price movements have occurred if price moves (10:41) significantly upwards from a level it is considered a demand Zone and if price moves significantly downwards from a level it is considered a supply Zone just like support and resistance these zones can be treated as key levels for potential entry positions Market structure Market structure is when Trader anal izes the behavior condition and flow of the market an uptrend structure is characterized by Price forming higher highs and higher lows while downtrend structure is characterized by Price forming lower highs and lower (11:13) lows break of structure it is when price breaks the previous price Peak during a trend for example if the price forms a higher highs and higher lows this break of the previous highs is called Break of structure change of character it occurs when price breaks the previous structure during a trend often signaling a reversal from that current trend for example if the price is forming higher highs and higher lows then it breaks the previous lows forming lower lows this is called a change of character so did I miss any strategy let

        "input": "What tools do I use for 2D and 3D Art? For sound  coding and all things game dev? Which tools should   you pick for your next game? It all comes down  to the idea of slowing down to go faster. Let's   start with 2d Art. So, first things first: Let's  talk about Aseprite. Some folks swear by it,   but in my humble opinion, this software  is overrated. (00:23) Why? Well, if you head over   to places like Pixel Joint and check out some  of the most jaw-dropping pixel art out there,   you're going to find out that Aseprite isn't the  tool that they are using to make those pixel art.   The main issue I have with Aseprite is that  it forces you to draw every single Pixel. And   believe it or not, that's not the go-to technique  used by top tier pixel artists and I know it may   sound counterintuitive because pixel art is all  about drawing pixels, right? but this is one of   those well-kept secrets in the world of pixel  art. We can delve deeper into it another time. (00:53) but just to demonstrate what I mean by this this  is how pixel art can be done outside of Aseprite:   I've set a color palette with some filters and  I'm just going to do one click with my mouse.   [one click with my mouse.] This is the result of  one click and now let's add some cracks here. I'm   going to take the brush tool and the pencil tool  and then yeah. (01:16) Let's tweak this sphere so it seems   like it's made of a different material. I would  love to see how long it would take to achieve   this sort of result with Aseprite. Sure Aseprite  is very easy to use and the alternative that I'm   going to talk here might take a bit more time  to master, but remember what we said: slow down   to go faster. (01:37) Although the idea of learning a new  software may seem intimidating, it can ultimately   help you work faster and produce higher quality  results. Now when it comes to 2D art it's hard   to beat the versatility of Photoshop. I've used  Photoshop in the past. It is a great software, but   I don't use it anymore. [I don't use it anymore].  Photoshop, it's like the Swiss army knife of art   software. You can create all sorts of art styles  with that. (02:00) In fact, many of the best pixel artists   actually use Photoshop for their craft. The main  catch is that is on the pricey side. Currently I   got two trusty tools that I use for 2D art: First  I have Photopea. It is a remarkable alternative to   Photoshop and I can't emphasize this enough it  is fantastic having used Photoshop for years I   can confidently say that Photopea offers almost  all the features you'd find in Photoshop. (02:23) You   can dabble in various art styles and play around  with layers blading options filters. You name,   it even if you're into pixel art, you can  restrict yourself to a pallet and Photopea   gots your back and best of all it costs zero USD  to use. Next up we have Krita. Now, it might be a   bit slower and havier in the system when you are  tinkering with filters, palletization, blending;   If we compare it to Photoshop or Photopea,  but it's still a stellar software. (02:50) Personally,   I use Krita for drawing and illustration,  especially when I'm using a drawing tablet.   Its brush controls are very good. It is also  possible to do animations in Krita: It has Nifty   features such as onion skinning, so that you can  see other frames while you're drawing a new frame   Krita can also be used for pixel-art, there's a  lot you can do with filters and palletization and   so on. (03:16) It is 20% more expensive than Photopea,  which means that you can get it for 0 dollars as   well. I use Krita for drawing and illustrations  using a drawing tablet and and when it's time   for Mouse based image editing I bring my art to  Photopea and I do most of the work there. Now what   do I use for design docks project management and  overall organization? Google Docs, Google Sheets,   and Google Slides. I admit these tools have no  aesthetic appeal. (03:38) Actually, they are ugly, but   they more than make up for it in functionality.  When you on the go and an idea strikes, you can   write it down from anywhere using your phone then  you can share collaborate annotate everything with   versioning of what changed and when so very simple  and effective. (03:54) Then we have Version Control I use   GIT and GitHub and for me this is a must. Trust  me, manually saving multiple versions of your   project for for every risk tweak you make will  lead to headaches in the long run. GIT may seem   complicated if you're new to it, but I believe  investing sometime to learn it well will pay   off big time down the road. Remember: slow down to  go faster. (04:15) Before we dive into the 3D tools I got   something to share with you: the Source-code of  my GameJam winning game. I've decided to make the   construct project available to you you will get a  behind the scenes look on how the game was set up,   how Marcos AI work, all the levels, all the  assets, and the nitty gritty details on how the   game works. (04:33) I'm creating a mailing list for the  folks who are interested in game development and   want to follow my journey as I bring this game to  Steam. And I want YOU to be a part of it. That's   why I'm offering you the actual source-project  complete with the assets, to open up the project,   run it and even modify it if you want. Sign up  in the list below and I will personally send you   the source-code of Awful Marco Bros. (04:52) Plus you  will see how user friendly the game engine I   use is. You will be able to open the project  without installing any software. All right,   now let's shift our Focus to 3d Art Tools. It has  been a while since I dipped my toes into 3d game   development. I've made some 3d assets of the game  you are seeing on the screen right now. This is a   game from 2008 and it was supposed to be a VR game  before Oculus Rift was a thing. (05:14) And as you can   guess this game never saw the light of day. While  I can't say I was particularly good at 3D art   back then, I'm eager to jump back in. Currently  I'm experimenting with 3D art and my next game   will likely incorporate some form of stylized  3D. First up we have Blockbench for modeling:   This tool can simplify the workflow for a specific  style of art I highly recommend checking out the   videos made by Brandon James Greer on this  subject. (05:40) The models created with Blockbench   have a distinct aesthetic that, in my opinion  fits perfectly with the kind of games that Indie   devs can create. As I mentioned in my previous  video, I wouldn't advise indie or solo devs to   chase after High-Fidelity Graphics; Instead opting  for a distinctive stylized 3d style could be your   best bet. (06:01) Now even though I'm leaning towards  Blockbench for 3d modeling Blender remains the   undisputable champion for rigging exporting  and editing all things 3d. So there's no way   around it Blender if you need 3d assets. Blender  is basically an essential part of any 3d artist   tool kit, unless you have very deep pockets  of course! So, distinctive stylized 3d look   is the strategy that I chose as a solo developer,  and while Blockbench may be my modeling tool of   choice I undoubtedly have to use Blender alongside  it. (06:26) For Audio I don't have much to say when it   comes to mixing and fine-tuning sound effects and  music tracks I use Audacity and I'm guessing most   of you are already familiar with Audacity.  For music I dabbed into some digital audio   workstation softwares in the past, however I'm not  planning on writing my own music at the moment,   and instead I'm using asset packs, royaltyfree  music, and from time to time teaming up with folks   that make music. (06:52) Game Engine: I've dedicated an  entire video to discuss my Game Engine of choice,   but here is a condensed version. Construct3 ticks  all the boxes for 2D Game Development. Also,   it boasts some basic 3D Features and most  importantly, it make me very productive. Plus it's   pretty decent for creating crossplatform games.  Programming Language: When it comes to coding,   TypeScript is a programming language I really  like. Plus I use it in my daily work. (07:12) It is   great not to have to context switch between  programming languag when I'm working on games   versus when I'm working in my daily job. I've  delv deeper into this topic in my previous video,   explaining why I prefer TypeScript over GDscript  and GML. So check out the video for more details   on that. The code editor that I use is Vscode. (07:31) Construct3 has this feature that exports all the   type definitions and the TS config of your project  in such a way that you can very easily use it in   Vscode to edit your code using autocomplete  for example. If you don't know vs code is   much lighter than its cousin Visual Studio, and it  has many extensions that you can use to customize   the editor and improve your workflow. Vscode also  plays nicely with Git. (07:52) While I personally prefer   using Git via the command line, those who are  getting started can have a much easier time using   it directly inside Vscode. And once again if you  are interested in following my journey bringing   an enhanced version of Awful Marco bros to Steam,  and also gain access to the project Source-code,   you can sign up for the meeting list. The link  is in the description. (08:11) And for those of you   curious to see these tools in action, stay  tuned for my next video. See you next time!.",
