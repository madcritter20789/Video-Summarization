**General**:
1. All tires wear out, but rotation helps them last longer and wear out more evenly.
2. New tires generally grip the road better than tires that have some miles on them.
3. GMC recommends rotating your tires every time you change your oil or 7,500 miles.
4. Riding on ball tires is definitely a safety hazard.
5. You also need proper tire balance.
6. An unbalanced or improperly balanced tire and wheel can make your car vibrate.
7. Bent wheels or a misaligned suspension can also produce uneven tread wear and cause tires to lose air..
