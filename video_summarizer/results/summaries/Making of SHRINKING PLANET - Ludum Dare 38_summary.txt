**General**:
1. Ludum Dary is a huge game development competition where you get 48 hours to create a game from scratch using only odd and code you make yourself.
2. Gravity and Quaternion were used to create the world.
3. I then created a first shader using a tutorial by Ellen Tukone and tweaked it to be used for grass.
4. I generated a grass texture in Photoshop, played around with the lighting a bit and added a gradient background.
5. So I decided to embrace it and add a single road that wraps around it" "The Kai's actually also inspired by his.
6. ng, mainly the motion player helped emphasize the action" "Busker Core" is a game about avoiding people you know on the street.
7. I created 5 different soundtracks.
8. I lost 2 of them because I accidentally hit the escape key.
9. The other 2 tracks just didn't fit the vibe of the game.
10. Thanks to all the awesome Patreon supporters who donated it in March.
11. And especially thanks to Derek Hemskirk, Face No Marifying, James Kellhound and Jason De Tito.

**Future Plans**:
1. The theme was Small World and I decided to stick with the theme of using a small planet as the game world.
2. The player controlling a red car would then drive around the planet trying to avoid meteors.
3. "I really suck at modeling but I think from a distance it ended up looking just fine" "My planet really reminded me of King Kai's.
