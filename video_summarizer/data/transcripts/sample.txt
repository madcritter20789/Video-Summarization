Hey, what do you want? Huh? Self? Yeah, that's not my name Okay What is your name then? No, no, I'm sorry to progress it Okay, turn Ferguson Yeah, what do you want? What should we do? I've got some hot links. I've got some ketchup. I've got some onions. What do you think? Peppers peppers gotta have some peppers. What's peppers? Obviously myself is being stubborn or turn Ferguson so bottom line is this we're gonna be making some spicy sausage sandwiches Green pepper Onion simple Cheap 60 cents 60 cents cheap But what do you need in order to cut those onions and peppers? Sharp stuff Hey, hey, hey sharpening. Hey, hey, no leave me alone. I'm playing rath racer Cut it And cut it good Peel that Mmm cut onions being a man Wow, I got a goose in my eye Hey, what in the world man what's going on? Geez next thing you know you're gonna burn your face off you break Don't need a hole on you Like it off onions or layers layers of onion be good On a spicy sausage sandwich cut them thinner Don't want it too thick either nice and thin slices Not like the big stupid bite that I took Small Green pepper green pepper take the label off Labels are nasty not good for one's health Peter I don't know what the white stuff is but you don't want it Pepper strips Helps stop you from crying from the young Fresh pepper And it wouldn't be spicy sausage sandwiches without Boom spicy hot links the best how much with these back one buck a buck all right We've spent how much now 220 not including tags. What's the last ingredient? All natural Catch up in the bottle Yeah, that's right look at me cover the label with my hand why cuz they're not a sponsor that's why How much was the bottle two bucks the whole meal cost less in five bucks now that's a poor man's meal. Let's cook it If you can't stay in the heat get out of the kitchen We're gonna cook this for about 45 minutes. What's that gonna do to catch up? Carmelize it. Oh How much ketchup enough? There you go Always remember to shake well Add links Right in that's what talking about Pepper's in onions right on top boom don't want to catch up the oil over Finally Cover and what's wrong with my cover it's too big for my pan why I Don't know I don't have pan covers. I'm poor. Sorry We've been said for about 45 minutes. Let's see what happens Mmm blanket, but not blink your eye maybe snap a finger 45 minutes will go by just like this The beauty of it is it cooks for 45 minutes right here on the stove This kind of thing you could stick in a crop pot and cook for seven hours wouldn't recommend cooking in any longer But still cooking for as long as you need or think necessary It's good low heat don't over boil it but you can see that ketchup caramelizing already turns into like a natural barbecue sauce for those green peppers onions Good stuff Now bread not just any bread, but you're gonna want to get yourself a stadium-style bun or a hokey Why me a little bit something a little bit of size to it a little hot dog bun is not gonna work now Oh Your self-aligned There Just a spoon for the sauce and veggies Mix it up a little bit here. I go That's what I'm talking about Some on there Smore onions I'm an onion lover myself Green pepper And bam just like that spicy sausage sandwiches Y'all and freaking hot let it cool down a little bit Now that is a tasty poor man's meal.
