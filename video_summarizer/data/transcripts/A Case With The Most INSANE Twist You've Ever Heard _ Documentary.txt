 9-1-1, what is the address of the emergency? There's a pool of blood. I'm guessing it's just an animal, but in the water right by the river there's a shoe. Well, everywhere. All over the place. Did you tell my boys you went first when? Who? That girl. No. If somebody said I said that, they're liars, man. Why am I outside of the outside of the space? And you got fall into the wall. You should do this. Call them and tell them to get over here. Look at your house over here and bring me something to code. I have a concern. That's why we won't talk to you. I don't know if you know what I'm saying. You guys think I did something until you right now I didn't? In the early morning hours of March 11, 2012, a chilling discovery is made near the Jordan River. As the investigation gets underway, police uncover a disturbing pattern of lies and deception. However, just as investigators approach a critical breakthrough in solving the case, their most promising lead quite literally disappears and a thin air. As it turns out of vanishing suspect, isn't the only shocking reveal in this twisted grime, but also the great lengths some would go to in order to exact revenge, including framing someone for murder. Are you about 12678,000? Yeah, I would say so. I'm just below the golf course for the bridge. There's a bridge for the pathway that you can cross to go up to the golf course. There's like one two big piles of blood and there's splatter blood all over the bridge and then right along the edge of the water there's like a red, uh, hit shoe in there. It could have just floated in, but I figured I'd better call you guys. As the police arrive at the scene and meticulously examine the pools of blood on the rocks, they immediately focus on conducting tests to determine whether it's human blood or an animal's. It consumes the investigators as their worst fears materialize before their eyes. The reports confirm the chilling presence of human blood. Despite their relentless pursuit, they're not able to locate anyone on the trail, leaving them puzzled by the unknown. Finally, after hours of an extensive search, they stumble upon a haunting site on the other side of the river, a lifeless body of a young girl drifting silently, a shocking testament to the unfolding tragedy. The young girl's body had remained submerged in the water for hours. Her face is swollen, bearing signs of severe trauma with multiple fractures. A prominent injury on her forehead had left her face disfigured and unrecognizable. The autopsy would later confirm that the cause of death was multiple blunt force injuries to the child's head. Notably, she wore a shoe that matched the one that was discovered by the jogger who'd placed the 911 call. In efforts to identify the victim, the police arranged for a press conference and share crucial information about the discovery in the hopes that someone would step forward with valuable information to aid their investigation. A mile away, Veronica Casper's axe switches on the television to watch the news. As she listens to the announcement, her blood runs cold with a chilling realization. Could this be her daughter, Annie? Fifteen-year-old Annie lives with her mother, Veronica Casper's axe, and stepfather James Bratcher. On Saturday night, Veronica and James return home from their dinner date, and Annie excitedly greets them at the front door. Seeing James ordinary as Veronica heads to her room for a shower while James hangs out in the kitchen. At 745, he notices Annie leaving the kitchen and heading towards a room. However, at 840, while on a phone call with her sister, Veronica realizes that she hasn't seen or spoken with Annie since they arrived home. She decides to check Annie's bedroom, only to find it empty. Alarmed, she calls out to her husband, who rushes upstairs with a note that he found in the other room. The note declared Annie's shocking revelation that she has left for California, confessing that she lied to her friends about being pregnant, which she had indicated with a pee in the letter, and she said that she could no longer bear the weight of the lie. With their hearts racing, Veronica and James immediately called the authorities to report Annie as a runaway. Soon after, Veronica reaches out to Christopher Bagshaw and his boyfriend, desperately seeking any information. While Christopher maintains that he was unaware of Annie's plans, he did know more than he was letting on. After a restless night with little sleep as Veronica switched on the news the next morning and witnessed the unfolding announcement, it dawned on her that Annie might not have made it to California after all. The uncertainty gripped her tightly, sending shivers down her spine. Veronica contacts the helpline and informs the police about her runaway daughter. She provides them with every piece of information as they carefully document each detail. Just when it seems like the conversation is about to end, the police ask a crucial question. Did Annie wear braces? The weight of this question hangs in the air and Veronica sobs on the other end of the line as she whimpers. Yes. When DNA match results arrive, the police are able to fully confirm the heartbreaking truth. The victim found on the trail is indeed 15-year-old Annie Casper's Ark. With the police officially confirming Annie's untimely death, her decision to run away becomes a pivotal element for their ongoing investigation as it could shed light on the circumstances surrounding her tragic fate. Rising the significance of understanding Annie's motivations, they pay a visit to her grieving family and uncover her harrowing past. As it turns out, Annie's early life was marred by the harsh reality of growing up in a reportedly unhealthy household. As a result, she endured a fragmented upbringing, moving between foster homes and child services centers. However, Veronica Casper's Ark and aspiring employee at Child Services became Annie's dedicated case manager. Over time, a deep connection formed between them, leading Veronica and her then-husband Dennis Casper's Ark to adopt Annie as their own. Despite the challenges that arose from Veronica and Dennis' subsequent divorce, Annie found solace in the love and care of her parents and their new partners. After noting the teenager's family history and background, the investigators meticulously gather various items connected to Annie, such as the note she left for her parents, tutors and mobile phones, and a tote brimming with papers, including her journals. While examining Annie's journals, the investigators uncovered something peculiar. Her profound obsession with her boyfriend, Christopher Bagshaw. Curious to know more about Chris and Annie's relationship, investigators decide to chat with Annie's classmates. Upon being questioned about her boyfriend, they consistently mention Christopher Bagshaw's name and disclose a circulating rumor about Annie being pregnant with his child. The same pregnancy that Annie mentioned in her note. Annie's parents informed the authorities that they were aware of Annie's relationship with Chris and had taken measures by encouraging her to use a birth control pill. Moreover, the autopsy report also confirmed that Annie was not pregnant. But why was Annie spreading such rumors at school? Veronica Casper's Act shares with the investigators that she believed Annie's false story about her pregnancy reflected her desire to build a permanent family she could call her own. A thought that was reflected in some of her journal entries. It seems that Chris Bagshaw may be able to share more information, and since he was so close to her, they initiate their line of questioning with him, hoping that he can shed some light on what may have really led Annie to run away. After acquiring a search warrant, law enforcement officers visit his home. Since he's a minor, Chris's father, Darwin Lee Roy Bagshaw, attends the interrogation with him. In the state of Utah, if a child is subject to a custodial interrogation for an offense, the child may not be interrogated unless they've been advised of their constitutional rights and their right to have a parent, guardian, or friendly adult present during the interrogation. The child has waived their constitutional rights. The child's parent, guardian, or friendly adult was present during the child's waiver, and has given permission for the child to be interrogated. Exceptions under the Safe Harbor Clause include a minor that has misrepresented themselves as being an adult aged 18 or older, an emancipated minor, or if the police have made reasonable efforts to contact an adult or guardian and are unable to reach them within an hour of the first attempt? If the child is in the custody of the division of child and family services and a guardian ad-litem has been appointed for the child, the child's guardian ad-litem has given consent to an interview of the child. In this never-before-seen interrogation, Chris openly discusses his relationship with Annie and readily shares his whereabouts on the night she ran away. The following footage has been analyzed by a qualified team, including a licensed professional counselor and a licensed attorney. How long do you think your conversation for with her? 6 months each. What did you guys talk about? She asked me to run away. I tried to find an answer not to. Over that thousand stupid idea. And to think about her family. Tell me about what kind of rumor for out there about you and Annie? I got her print, but I didn't. When did you find out? Or when did she start telling you that? That what? That she was pregnant with your baby? She didn't start telling me. She started telling her what else. Around month after, she had that. So, it was all right. Annie had written about L.J. and some of her journal entries. Though this is the first time L.J. is mentioned in the questioning, he will play a crucial role in the investigation. When did she tell you that she was pregnant? Around month after. About a month after? When did you think that was about a month? Well, she had had with L.J. and no family. Tell us more about her. How you know about her? I'll tell you more about her. She told me that she didn't want her family to find out that. She and L.J. sneak into her house next to her. Because Annie L.J. was 17. So, she asked me if I can take whiteboard and title. Did that help? That I would agree to let her know when it is written. Chris appears really tense here, barely moving and gripping onto the arms of his chair. He's leaning back and away from the detective. While it could be that he's just distraught about the death of his girlfriend, he appears disengaged and has a quite flat affect. While everyone responds to death differently, and this could be shock, the detective is likely concerned about him appearing detached. How many times did you have to say once? When was the night that we went out and searched ourselves? When was it about what month or day it was Wednesday or Thursday last week? Wednesday or Thursday last week? After answering all the questions, Christopher volunteers more information to the police about an incident at Suarez. And then, he was an incident at Spencer's home. Also, like when the scum just started doing all, she had got a bloody nose and it tripped on the shoe. And then she ran into that, and then we went to her room. It's certainly odd that Chris is so concerned about explaining a few drops of blood on his shoe. Though he might be aware of how this could look, and therefore wants to make sure the police know there is an innocent explanation for it. This story is reminiscent of a guilty person making a 911 call, not so they can get help, but so they can get their alibi set up. Tell one of your students that, what are we up to, what's up, fucking you? Um, can't you drop now? There's a crack. I have no book on this, you hear? Listen to the door. This is Dad. The long clock. He was all the most up here. This is the closet. And Spencer was here. He's kind of dosing off me this way. How was I here? And amused I hear? No, he's saying the same. Yes. You and Annie were here. It's all on the side of it, Dad. Okay. You mentioned that it was all startling now, Dad. I don't know, but I just, we're sitting right here, and we can't be looked over at him. It was like, right now, I said, do you have a little something like that? Sure, Dad. I'm going down, and I'm going down. I'm going down, and he's just going to go to the back room. So it's like, what's up with it, what's up with it, a fallen one? This one? It's about falling on your life, but? Okay, you would have just been one drop. Yeah. And then what happened did she go to? When you don't have to do it at this, like, so walk in the next bathroom right across from it, and then there's a bedroom, the hand, and there's this. And she got a bloody note taken care of? Yeah. Did you know that? Did she believe it's built across the floor? No, I'm not sure. She was falling on her own like this. So it was not quite a shared hope, but I know. No, she just like grabbed it so they wouldn't trip anymore. After taking notes on the incident, they returned to the topic of Chris's last conversation with Annie in order to get additional details. Well, did you guys talk about sites running away? What's that on it? I just tried to convince her to think about it twice, and think it over, and think there's something wrong with the family and to think about everything good. I mean, I tried to convince her that it wasn't a good idea. And that she should be doing. Think about her friends as well. Okay. And what did you do after eight o'clock? Well, where were you out when you were talking to her? My dad had left to go to the bar. And I went to McGillons at first. What time? Do you think you... Oh. Oh, Saturday night. Imagine I probably... I'll have call right off. Six or seven. What party does it? I'll wait until the night. So did you leave right when you're deadlocked? No. I stayed home and I played the video game for a little while. For how long do you think? Um, an hour and an hour and a half. Did it... was anybody else there with you? No, it was just me. Anybody call you? Were you there, do you remember? No. And then afterwards, I went to my grandma's house, which is only three doors down. I called you that night. Oh, you did? Because I told you I was going to have a problem with you. Yeah. You were sitting on a crumbly house. What time did you ask them to stay with her? What time did you call them to think? Oh. Oh man. You must like eight or seven. Seven, forty-five to eight. I'm not real positive on these at times that I call them. And so when you called, did you go right over your grandma's? No, I stayed home a little bit. I played the video game because that was like an idiot or an aunt. We're talking about just last Saturday, right? Yeah. Okay. No, I left the house at six o'clock last Saturday. I left with a buddy named Kevin. The police consider this line of questioning crucial as they try to determine if they can confirm Chris' location during the possible time of Annie's murder. So are any coaches you think seven, forty-five eight? And then did you go right to your... And you said you stayed home from another hour, probably, without a... Like, for another fifteen minutes to give my stuff ready. And I went to my doubles. Talk about what happened to your girl. Well, I didn't stay in my grounds for pretty much a day. I went there, put my stuff there. And I asked her if I could go and see her friend and not because I didn't know her. I was staying there. She's kind of wanting to know that. But... But I went to my friends. I know some of the story didn't answer. So I went straight back to my girl. I got a movie. I did my friend with my movies. Did you ever read the house again? You know. She said there's only... Yes. And I got home at about eleven thirty. And I went by my mom's house and he was crashed out on the chair. And I talked to her for a minute and I went home. So I told him that I was probably going to have company come over which they ended up not coming over. So I asked him ahead with the bed. And then he was home by nine in the next morning. Sure. Did you talk to anybody on the phone after you got back to your grandma's? I didn't. How far would you say your friend's house is from New Yorkshire? It's around twenty five and he walked in. So like my house? Two my house or fifteen my house? Yeah. Just like my house. For some around the mile. So you stay back twenty five minutes, one way and twenty five minutes back. Yeah. Despite the corroboration of Chris's whereabouts on the night of the incident by his father, Darwin Lee Roy Bacchaw and his grandmother Wilma Fernbocla, the police focused their attention on two crucial details provided by Chris that demand verification. The first concerns Annie's nose blade, which supposedly occurred at Spencer's house, resulting in her blood and inadvertently staining Chris's shoe. The second piece of information relates to Annie's alleged relationship with another boyfriend named LJ. The police take the necessary steps to acquire a search warrant for the home of Spencer Crittle to uncover the truth. As a close friend of Chris and Annie, Spencer can give some insight into both of these questions. He soon becomes a person of interest in the investigation and is subsequently brought in for questioning. The investigators waste no time and immediately inquire about the night Annie left. On that day Saturday, you had talked about Annie coming here. I Annie's talking, calling you and you weren't here. Tell me about that. What were you doing that day? I went to the gym with my little brother. Okay. With your little brother? My older brother. And how long will you guys have to have the gym? For two hours. Two hours. Yeah, for a long time. You feel like you've been going there for two hours? Like, chance of usage? Yeah, that's not Marines. Okay. And then, so then, what time did you get back to the house? Around the 830. And then, is that when you checked your messages? Yeah, I went upstairs and got like 10 minutes, 20 minutes later, and there's like text messages and calling messages and everything. No text messages from Annie just like, two missed calls I think from Annie, one voice message. Okay. And then, do you have your cell phone? Is that the way I've got the messages? Yeah. Do you have it with you here? Yeah. Do you mind if we take a look at it? The thing is though, I don't know, number, thread calling me. There's the call logs. I don't know, number, let's try finding some way to get that voice message back for anything. And attorney will almost always advise you not to willingly hand over your phone or other devices, unless the police have a warrant. After, the gym on Saturday night, then what should you do? Came home, my dad was like, you guys are really, I was like, yeah, I should've let him make it pop back. I was like, I guess, after I had pop back, well, that's actually before, when my dad was making a check my messages, after a chance, literally trained out my energy, and then I felt sleep for a second on his bed, and I was like, it up for the dinner. And after that, we got on the PS3 industry, and just started watching Netflix and playing games. I kept the phone right there, just waiting for him to recall. I was like, I'm on, good. Good next day, nothing. For operation with the police, yield significant revelations. He substantiates Chris' statement by confirming that Annie did bleed from her nose when they were at his place, and shares some intriguing information about LJ. There was some confusion about whether you actually physically talked on the phone or had a chat with LJ. Did you ever? I'm a child of LJ. Yeah. He just messaged me on his email. Okay, that's all. And so it was over email. Yeah. So much he hacked in. He hacked into LJ. So as Annie's email. And then, but it was from LJ. Yes. So how did you know it was LJ? Because Annie the next day, well, he told me. Oh, Annie, this is LJ. Yeah. LJ, why are you on? You know, Annie is like, oh, I hacked into it. I was like, oh, that's perfect. But you never had a physical, like a conversation with them about that. No. Okay. That was how long ago? It was back in like, I think either late November or early December. It was one of those I can't remember. I said out of the ordinary, I don't know calls. So you get it all the time. You know, well, sorry, I thought you said, do you usually get unknown calls? No, I don't. So that's uncommon. Yeah, that's uncommon. Unless it's one of my friends that are playing Frank on me, but they haven't done that a long time. So I don't know who could back to it then. Because I can't call back. It'll be like no number. I'm like, do you know, does your band ever like check through your, do you see them on the counter? I think you have a team mobile online for phone bills and check like that phone records. Yeah, he actually tried searching up my phone record and he couldn't like, I think he couldn't like, I think he found it. We all asked him is there any way we can get the voice message please and it's like, no, it's not. One of the texts email where he talked to LJ, whatever. Hello to that. Well, since I was months ago, my phone just built up and. And like the memory and it goes berserk. I can't like start taking pictures or anything. It's a memory. So I had to clear it out. I always do that. It's too much call. And this is just clears out. Apart from confirming LJ's involvement with Annie, Spencer informs the police that all of their circle of friends had tried to warn her to stay away from LJ, given his threats. As they believed he was a member of some gang. Chris's statement highlighted a similar pattern. Hi Chris, one of the things that was coming up and everything is that in talking with LJ, when you talked with LJ, did you actually physically talk to him on the phone or was it like through a message or how did you talk to him? I thought to him once. Okay. Actually, I'm okay. And what did he say in that conversation that we were straight like we are calling. He wasn't coming anymore for me, but he did say that he was coming for somebody else and then he hung up. Okay. And when you talk to him on the phone, did he speak with an accent or do you know say anything distinctive about his voice? No. Just normal. Okay. Just normal voice. And was there phone number for that? No, it was just a strict. It said we strict it on it. The pivotal information shared by both boys thrust the police investigation forward. Firmly casting LJ is the prime suspect and Annie's gruesome murder. Unfortunately, neither Spencer, Chris, nor any of Annie's other friends had ever seen LJ, which limits their ability to provide a physical description. However, the investigators have deep connections and immediately mobilize their informant networks and surveillance circuits to search for a 17 year old individual with potential gang ties and relations with anyone at Annie's school. After a grueling week of relentless pursuits and exhaustive investigations, the investigators find themselves empty handed. Just as the mounting pressure takes its toll on the team, one of the investigators receives a crucial phone call providing them with their long awaited breakthrough in the seemingly impossible search. The caller is Joanna Franklin, an individual frequently involved in alleged credit card deaths. She declares that she had actually witnessed Annie's murder and hopes to exchange the information for eliminating all charges against her legal activities. The following never before seen footage of Joanna Franklin's interview reveals her shocking claims of a crime. She drops a bombshell at the very beginning by revealing that she knows the elusive LJ quite well. Moreover, she introduces a new suspect to the investigations list. And that's when the days have a matter to go, what if you start laughing at the case? There is a lot. I would say 99, some people we've talked to said, never do that always. I'm not sure you can do that. She left it in front of everybody. It wasn't always there. It wasn't what she wanted to do. She laughed in front of everybody. She started laughing and I started laughing. That was it. Everybody reading papers, she said no, no, it's okay. Because you laughed at him. I'd probably laughed too. You had to get a good mind. You got it all you did. Yes, anybody. If you do it with that, I'd say, yeah. A whole bunch of them. And I go, yeah, right there is anybody in the angle for a word. And he's like, I just needed it. You grab people at the door on the outside and he's like, what am I supposed to do? I'm like, I'm a face. And you guys fall into the wall. And I was like, what are running outside? And he's like, stay out of here. And he's like, just stay out of there. And I'm like, you can't be okay with that. And she's like, she's going to be like, she was shaking, not shaking. And that was when I there was... Were she here? Yeah. She was bleeding. Mm-hmm. From her ears and her nose and her mouth. And then he kicked her right she was on the ground. And he had him like, tire out and from that car. And they didn't, they wouldn't come in. Like, what is that girl's name? How did you know her? How did I know her? How did you know that it's our victim? How did you know that it's this girl? I thought the picture that I heard. Where are? On the news. It was a couple days. Like, I was told that, like, two different stories. Like, oh, we took her home. We got dropped, she's fine. And then, like, once they started getting high, then the story changed. And that's when I was like, what the... Joanna is incredibly animated. You can see her eyebrows moving a lot as she talks, which indicates that she's seeking approval from the officers while also making very intense eye contact. As she talks, her speech sounds pressured, meaning she's talking without many pauses. This may be because she really wants to get her story out, but it's often associated with substance use and a variety of mental illnesses. It's also noteworthy that she says, L.J. and that girl. She doesn't say Annie's name, yet she's naming everyone else. When the officer starts asking questions, she seems to get a bit more anxious and is rubbing her head in ears. She also rubs her nose rather awkwardly. For all of her animation, her emotion doesn't seem to fit. She doesn't seem scared or worried. And I know, what did you guys do? He'll tell me where that person is. And so that's when I kind of like started to get ginger. She'd kind of stay off that way. And she'd laugh just like, no, any driver. And it's flunger around in the wall. It's your life. Where I was sitting today. There was nothing mind me. That wasn't there before. He went to and righted that wall. He loved it everywhere. All of his life. I remember like these. It was hard. It's just such a good boy that broke in. I didn't get any strength form. And we kind of scooted back. And the table kind of scutched across the floor. I loved my disgust on the air. I remember being like, no, no, no, no, what happened. He doesn't happen. It comes all worried about it, because I'm there. And we all kind of sat there for a minute. We finished being pissed. Like, you know, he passed down the house. So, he was, how do you know? And he was, how do you know? And he was, how do you know? He was laughing. He was laughing. He was laughing. He was, what are you doing? And he was, you'll start. And as he came in, he was, what's happened? And he was laughing. He was, she laughed at you. And he was, yeah. And he was, what's she laughed at you? He was, oh, what's she laughing at me? And I became scared to have met. I was like, how much did I have to say anything? I'm sorry. And I go, are you serious? And I stood up and he was, like, I'm like, didn't you like what's really concerned? So I sat down. And I go, I need to go check on her. And he goes, no, you need to go get me some towels. And I tarp on the sword of shit and shout you, no. So I go get that. And I go, that's nothing. I walk that guy in there. He's doing that. He was just pale white. Poli white, not moving. And I was like, what's wrong? And she goes, hey, she's getting a look. And I said, next you want to kind of move it once you get it. Like that. She's okay. She's okay. And I kind of move her cheek a little bit and like, her jaw is like, where it should be fine. And I was like, something else. I catch her up and I'm not sure I'm a white, or whatever. And then I think that he was, what's the damage, doc? And I go, she's a little hospital. He goes, hmm, can't do that. And I go, he goes, we can't do that. And I was like, what are you going to do? He's like, cool. So he goes. And I saw him. He went the other way around. He's quiet and he's like, shout me. He's like, you're stupid. Oh man, I'm telling them to get over here. You can just go over here and bring me to the change clothes. And they'll do it just south on the couch. He just sat there. I was like, under the tarp. And they had him pull up. I was like, shoot the bathroom. And moved her from outside by the table to the bathroom to change her clothes. I was like, I'm going to get her under a dress and try out. No, why? Like, you're still home, I don't know what else I'm going to be. He's like, okay, I need another quick, something's cleaned up. And I'm like, can I do this? Because if you can, you're fine. You're like, I'll make work you well. I'm like, no, you won't. I can't do this. I'm not like this. This is exactly what you're like. He's like, you know how many would I need? The money. He's like, so over to Walmart or wherever, he's going to go. He's going to be able to get some bleeds in the cab bleeds. He's like, I'm not going to get any. I'm sorry, I went back and the bleeds I can't out of there. And he's going to do any of these for it. All the wall. All the wall. And he's going to scrub it. He's going to scrub it. He's going to scrub it. And then he had to do the baseboards. And then we all went to the floor. And they went back and back. And he's like, these little stuff. I'm like, oh my goodness. Stop. And he goes, go blow on it. And I go, yeah, okay. That's what kind of thing. All together, we ended up throwing the duster. And that was on Sunday morning. You said you were a dresser, right? You were a dresser. Where did that clothing come from? Right. That's what we're doing. And what all was there? There was a redder of black top in the pants and shoes. Joanna's description of the clothes was strikingly similar to what Annie was wearing that day the investigators had discovered her body. She further informs the investigating team that the person she claims was involved and LJ took the girl's body in a suburban and went to the canyons. On their return, they declared that the girl went swimming and won't come back. With Joanna's interview, the investigating team finally find their first witness who can describe LJ's physical looks. She shares that he's shorter than her. He's Hispanic, but looks white, and he's 19 years old. Her information proves to be a comprehensive breakthrough, taking all the necessary boxes and providing answers to the key inquiries the police had been tirelessly pursuing. With her eyewitness account of LJ's presence, they now had irrefutable confirmation of his involvement in Annie's murder. Moreover, the other man she was accusing and claimed to be involved, John. John was a convicted felon, a self-admitted substance dealer and a gang member. John's lengthy rap sheet further indicated his potential role in committing the dreadful crime. The investigators waste no time obtaining a search warrant for John's residence and promptly conduct a raid, as anticipated his house exhibited clear signs of attempting to conceal a grievous offense. The walls were freshly painted, the carpet in the hallway was removed, and the entire place appeared to be undergoing remodeling. The absence of the carpet and red stains on the door's raised significant suspicion, indicating a potential cover-up, the visuals corroborated Joanna's statement. The police promptly arrest John to interrogate him. As Annie's family grapples with the confusing reality of her involvement with possible addicts and gangs, John goes through intensive questioning with the police. I've only got your picture. How do you know her? Brittany? Is her name Brittany? No, Danny. You might know her, Brittany. Tell me about Brittany. Brittany, she's um, friends with um, do you just have an ear? Friends will tell. Do you just tell me straight up, Matt? I want to know what you have to say first. I'll think of everything I need to know, Matt, because she's how cool, dude. She's Brittany. She lives with Sal. But she stays with Sal. She's Mercedes, friend. Mercedes, friend? Yeah, and um, do you just have a hammer in her? She'll bend to your house. Yeah, she just came to my house the other day. Does someone have her? On a scale of zero being not at all, and 100% positive that you know her is Brittany. Where are you out on that? I hate you. Pretty sure that's Brittany. I'm 10 ohm. Are you saying 80 out of 100? See the way. You're the same thing. I appreciate her. So it's her. 10 being 100% positive for your 8 out of 10 that it's her. Dude, I swear to God. Hold on. Her phone just takes it me today. I'll answer your questions in a minute. You got a text from her and call from her today or phone. Yeah, so it's less than we saw her. That uh, that day. That Saturday? Yeah, I was going to give my house. So what was that? She went to, she's visiting a house. I was down and down. Who's the house? It's doing you a cell and um, and cell I don't know a cell, a cell in the room. I just call a cell. Her boyfriend's supposedly L.J. L.J. or J.L. You may know her as Brittany. Her really name's Annie. Okay. You guys here in the other day. No, I think she's Brittany. I don't know. She was at my house last Saturday. There's no young girls in my house, man. No. No. Ever. As far as I know, they're young. I sent them the fuck out of there. What if she looked older? Oh, I just did, man. I do something. Am I supposed to eat some of this person? I have a concern. That's why we won't talk to you. I don't know. You guys think I did some drum to me right now? I didn't. And if you feel like I have, then I need a lawyer then.

Okay, but do you know about your wife getting pissed at you over one of your friends and some girl having pissed in your bed? She can mad at me over that. She didn't? No. Really? Hey, nobody had... My bed with me and my wife. Despite John's adamant denial of having any involvement in Annie's murder, or even any association with her, his prior criminal record provided enough justification for the police to keep him in custody as they gathered further evidence to support his potential involvement in the case. Yet when the DNA match reports and phone records arrive, the case takes an appalling turn that no one imagined. None of the blood samples found on the doors and walls of John's house match Annie's DNA. It was obvious that a crime occurred at John's residence, but there's no evidence indicating Annie's presence whatsoever. Moreover, John's phone records from that night don't place him even close to the area of Annie's death. This revelation leaves the investigators utterly bewildered and shocked, prompting them to reconsider their approach and conduct another interview with Joanna. And a twist beyond comprehension, Joanna breaks down under intense questioning and reveals her secret. It turns out that John hadn't been lying in interrogation. He actually didn't know Annie at all. However, John had betrayed Joanna by cutting her out of a deal and accalculated active vengeance. She meticulously gathered information on Annie's case from the news reports and constructed a story that pinned the blame on John. She confesses to orchestrating this elaborate plan to exact revenge and secure immunity for her crimes. It appeared John's alibi from the night of Annie's murder was actually another crime he was involved in. John and his ally ended up pleading guilty to kidnapping charges from that night, but the investigation into Annie's death derailed by a year because of the misleading information. The investigators are left with no choice but to retrace their steps and meticulously sift through their vast collection of past interrogations and searches they conducted before Joanna's pivotal call. Amerced in this intensive review, they stumbled upon three tip calls that instantly peaked their curiosity. The first tip was from someone who had been driving home the night Annie was killed and saw a male on a bike leaning over the South Side barrier and looking into the river. He was leaning so far over that she thought he would fall in. Another tip came from someone else who had said that he saw it 2.30pm that day by the Rotary Park, a young male was saying won't get caught, won't get caught, waving his arms around. He was short with dark hair almost to his ears, a full head of hair and was wearing a grey shirt and blue shorts. And then there had been a third tip from Christopher Bagshaw and his boyfriend because he had been receiving threats from LJ. All three tip calls pointed towards a teenager being involved in Annie's murder. Although this once again reaffirmed that LJ appeared to be a strong suspect, the police still didn't have a physical description and had yet to find him. Determined to uncover crucial details, investigators focus on Annie's phone records to get evidence of her phone conversations and retrieve LJ's profile. The investigators hunch proves correct when a disturbing pattern emerges as they discover that Annie received multiple calls from a blocked number on the night of her murder. The individual behind this blocked number spoke with Annie until the fatal hour leading up to her death. It was believed that this mysterious caller could possibly be LJ. Drawing upon Chris and Spencer's testimonies regarding LJ's threats towards them, the investigators promptly contact the telephone department to establish a connection between LJ and the blocked number found in Annie's phone records. They request the extraction of call data from Chris and Spencer's phones to note if they ever received or answered calls from the same suspicious number. If the numbers match, it could provide crucial evidence to solidify their suspicions in the case. But when the data arrives, the brutal and disturbing details rattled the entire investigating team. It becomes evident that every person involved has been withholding crucial information and telling lies. The police now had to once again reach out to each individual they had interviewed two years ago. The detectives begin their renewed round of interviews by arranging a meeting with Spencer Crittle and providing him with a search warrant report for his house. The report revealed the absence of any blood evidence within his house despite his statement that he witnessed Annie's nose bleed while at home. Under intensified questioning, Spencer eventually admits that he never personally witnessed the incident, but believes it happened because Chris talked to him about it. The detectives then meet with Wilma Fernbachley, Chris's grandmother, who becomes a key figure in the investigation. According to Chris and his family's account, he had supposedly spent the entire night of Annie's murder at his grandmother's home, starting from 7.45pm. However, the call records present a peculiar inconsistency that showed Wilma had called Chris multiple times, even well past midnight. However, she's uncooperative during the interrogation process and insists that Chris had returned to her house approximately one to one and a half hours after leaving to meet his friend. She continues to pair it similar series of events that happened that night as Chris had told them. She recalls making only one phone call to him that night and has no recollection of any additional calls or the approximate timings. However, it would soon be uncovered that she was clearly withholding crucial information. Additionally, Darwin Lee Roy Bagshaw, Chris's father, had stated that he had seen his son dosing off on the couch at his mother's home around 11.30pm. However, the reliability of this claim is called into question by call records, which indicate that Chris had called his grandmother Wilma Boclay at 12.47am that night. Why would she call Chris if he was sleeping in her living room? It seemed Chris and his family were hiding something out of fear. Given that he'd been threatened in the past, police considered that perhaps LJ had threatened him again. As the investigators weighed on the details about the owner of the blocked number, they also asked the telephone departments to trace the precise locations of all the individuals involved. The resulting data from this search unveils a stunning revelation that turns the entire investigation on its head. As it turned out, Chris is the owner of the blocked number and had a different phone to use it. But if this was the case, and Chris had made those calls, where is LJ? Had they planned this elaborate lie together? Chris was the only one who could answer their questions. Investigators find out that he moved to Colorado for his sophomore year and swiftly leave for the state to interrogate him. Overwhelmed and apprehensive, Chris succumbs to the intense questioning and reveals shocking details that seemed far too sinister for someone his age. Chris informs them that there is no LJ. As he narrates his tale of lies and deception, he confesses to the detectives that he discovered that Annie had created a fictional person named LJ to make him jealous. He had used the same name and any story to divert their investigation. Spencer had been protecting him as a friend, unaware that Chris had committed the heinous crime that took Annie away forever. He had message Spencer saying, the cops might come back to your house. I need you to tell them Annie got a bloody nose. Another said, they took my shoes for my testing and I need you to tell them that so I don't get blamed. I just want you to know I'm not telling you to lie to the cops. I just know you were kind of dozing off that night. Chris's admission of guilt put several missing pieces together. During their search, the police found that Chris's bike was similar to what the tip call witness had seen. Further investigation revealed that the other witness who had seen a teenager chanting over the bridge was the same day that Chris had actually skipped school. Police also found a note in the trash can of his home in which Chris had listed out a detailed timeline of Annie's disappearance and what she was wearing that night. There could only be one reason Chris would know of such details. He had been the one to kill her. Comments Chris posted on Facebook after Annie's death were viewed from a completely different perspective after the disturbing revelation. It turns out that the purpose of the posts wasn't to honor a beloved friend, but rather an effort to deflect any potential suspicion away from himself. The comments read as follows. Everyone wear red tomorrow. It was her favorite color and let's show how much we really care. And the world is filled with hate and no one understands the pain of losing someone they care about until it's too late and they're already gone. It's sad what had happened to Annie and I don't know why anyone would do this to someone like her. She was awesome and we all loved her very much. Even though we had times where we disliked each other, we always made up and reevaluated our friendship. She was the best. But what gave him away was Veronica and his mother's phone call. On the night Annie went missing, she'd called to ask if he knew anything. Chris had answered the call minutes after he'd taken her daughter's life. The location on Chris's cell phone on that call put him next to Annie near that bridge. While Annie's family had endured two long years of suffering, Chris had moved on and continued his life in Colorado as though nothing had occurred. The police arrested on charges of first-degree murder and obstruction of justice. But why had he killed Annie? That's sickening detail wouldn't be revealed until later. As Chris Bagshaw was 14 at the time of the crime, a state of Utah was likely to place him in a juvenile facility, allowing his release at 21. Given that he was 17 at the time of his arrest, it would result in him serving a mere three years in prison for the heinous offense. While investigators diligently sought evidence to support trying Chris as an adult in court, a pivotal moment arose when they received a call from the juvenile detention center. The caller, an inmate, steps forward to provide information about Chris Bagshaw, significantly bolstering the prosecution's case. This particular inmate had developed a friendship with Chris, who, in his overconfidence, revealed the chilling details of Annie's murder. Back in school, Chris had found out that Annie had been telling people she was pregnant with his baby, and he believed the claim, even though this wasn't true. She asked him to run away with her, so he suggested they meet by the bridge. Annie snuck out that night to meet him near the Jordan River. However, Chris had planned something terrible. He attacked Annie with a shovel, hitting her face until it was disfigured. Then he put the shovel on her forehead, jumped on it, and continued until Annie stopped moving. The investigators took this information to a state medical expert who checked Annie's autopsy report, and corroborated the inmate's description of the injuries on Annie's face, especially the one to her forehead. Chris had killed Annie because he believed she was pregnant with his child. Darwin, Christopher Bagshaw, was eventually tried as an adult and pleaded guilty to first degree murder. He was sentenced to 15 years to life in prison, and will be eligible for parole in 2034. A recording captured a message from Spencer to his friends, clearly said in jest, no one had any idea that Chris may have been scheming his own murderous plans at this very moment. You know, I never wanted to do this, but sometimes you just got a point. Hey, how are you doing? You're all right. So back off. What the crap? It was just late.
