 So Ludum Dary 38 just got wrapped up and the review process has now started. If you don't know, Ludum Dary is a huge game development competition where you get 48 hours to create a game from scratch using only odd and code you make yourself. As always, the theme was announced in the middle of the night, so when I woke up I was stoked to see that my favorite one had been selected. The theme was Small World. So I quickly pulled out the whiteboard and started sketching out ideas. I thought about making a 2D planet with changing terrain that the player would have to pass by and a city building game with way too little space to build on. I ended up scrubbing both ideas, however I decided to stick with the theme of using a small planet as the game world. The player controlling a red car would then drive around the planet trying to avoid meteors and to up the difficulty the planet would get smaller and smaller over time. With this idea in mind I created a to-do list and finally it was time to boot up Unity. I quickly got some controls up and running but for some reason I just couldn't get them to feel right. I tried a number of solutions but kept on getting either jittery movement, back collision, imprecise controls, weird camera movement and the list went on. Finally I ended up using a mix of rigid body gravity calculation and Quaternion that rotate to apply input driven rotation on top of that. Satisfied with the movement I jumped into blender to replace the default sphere with a smoother one. Creating the meteors went really quick. I'd already implemented gravity and so it was just a matter of using random dead on unit sphere to spawn meteors at random points around the planet and on collision energy to place a creator where they hit. Also made the planet shrink over time. I then created a first shader using a tutorial by Ellen Tukone and tweaked it to be used for grass. I generated a grass texture in Photoshop, played around with the lighting a bit and added a gradient background. After that I did some post processing, mainly the motion player helped emphasize the action. I created some particle effects for the meteors, being able to add noise to the particles made them look so much cooler. And finally to finish the graphics overhaul I modeled a quick creator in blender. Happy with the look of the game so far I went to bed at around 2am. After I could not sleep I felt ready to work on the car. Now I really suck at modeling but I think from a distance it ended up looking just fine. At least after I blew it up. I now felt it was time to add a score count to the game. I thought it would be fun to have UI elements follow the planet so I made it interpolate towards the center as the planet shrunk. In fact I like the effect so much that I decided to do the same thing to the end screen. Now I've always been a huge Dragon Ball fan and my planet really reminded me of King Kai's. So I decided to embrace it and add a single road that wraps around it. The Kai's actually also inspired by his. When it came time to making some music I felt really inspired and helped right into Busker Core. I ended up creating 5 different soundtracks. That's right, 5. I lost 2 of them because I accidentally hit the escape key. I mean seriously, why would that close it without warning? Why? The other 2 tracks just didn't fit the vibe of the game. They were too dark. So for the 5th one I went for something simple and happy. Next I created a main menu to which I added the player controls and a cool scene transition. I also slept some quick sounds on the current videos and wrapped it up by creating an icon for the game. I submitted it just before the deadline. This is what I looked like at the end. Time for a bath and a shave. For this time I love the girlfriend participated for her first time. You guys might know her as Sophie Bup from the forums. She made a game about avoiding people you know on the street. Also she is now full time on breakeys as well and has actually been doing most of the video editing the last 3 months. So big thanks to her. You'll find links to both games in the description go and play and review them all you want. I hope you will enjoy playing them just a fraction of how much we enjoyed making them. That's pretty much it for this video. If you enjoyed it make sure to subscribe and maybe check out some of the other behind the scenes videos I've done for previous Ludum Darius. All in all, thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video. Thanks to all the awesome Patreon supporters who donated it in March. And especially thanks to Derek Hemskirk, Face No Marifying, James Kellhound and Jason DeTito.
